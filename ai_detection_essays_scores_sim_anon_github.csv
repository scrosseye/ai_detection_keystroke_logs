1,APPEARANCE,"Each day that we live in reality, each day that we leave our
homes, and each day that we look at our phones, we are
consistently shown a variety of eye catching
advertisements and social media. A big part of what
makes advertisements, and media so enticing to 
consumers  is that it catches our eye and attracts us as 
consumers. Many things catch our eye because of the way
appearances can look. It is easier to judge and analyze
everything around us just based on the first look that we
see.Images and impressions do have too much of an 
effect on consumers because it affects the mental health
and well being of consumers.

In the case of social media, attractive and clever
appearances have too much of an effect on the user of
social media. Uers of social media, such as instagram,
are consistenly shown images of celebrities and models.

social media can cause a degradation of mental health and
well being. There are many consumers of social media 
that do not feel good about themselves after looking at
celebrities because they compare themselves to
unattainable standards. If images and impressions did not 
have too much of an effect on people, consumers of social
media would not have their mental health disturbed.

In conclusion, images and impressions have too much of
an effect on people. Impressions and images have a
massive effect on people because looks matters too much
to people. The use of social media is evidence that images
and impressions matter too much to consumers because it
can  affect their mental health and well being. People place 
too much importance on appearance and good looks that
it affects the way that they see themselves, other people, 
and the advertisements and media that we consume.

This can be seen by watching commercials. You see a commercial for a fast food restaurant and the food looks delicious. You get in your car and drive to the restaurant to eat the food you just saw on the television. You get your food and take a bite and realize that it is not as good as you thought it would be. The commercial made it look better than it actually is. 

You see politicians promise many things when they are on the campaign trail. In reality, once they are elected they actually get very little done for the people that they represent. People vote for candidates that look the part not necessarily the best politician.

People love entertainers who are beautiful and fit. They don't really care how well they entertain or act as long as they look beautiful while out in public.

4,MATERIALISM,"Modern society tends to reward materialism to a rather extreme extent. Most individuals are constantly chasing material items in order to improve their own circumstance. While chasing after these material goods is  a necessary part of our modern world, it can also lead to unexpected consequences. Those who solely case after material goods deserve a level of criticism.

The world  created by our recent ancestors requires some level of materialistic beliefs in order to survive. We need income to pay our bills,acquire food, and even gain some level of enjoyment. While this is a requirement for mordern life, there are some who take this belief over the top. Some among us live their lives solely to acquire material goods. Some individuals go to great lengths, such as stealing, manipulating others, and hurting other individuals, to gain weath and staus symbols.

Our modern society has done a better job of harming those who cause harm to others through their materialistic view. Examples of this can be found anywhere on socisl media, with thr general public criticizing and policing materrialistic individuals and causing harm to their reputation. Many of these actions cause those who are criticized to back off of their public display of materialistic tendencies.

Some retort that materialism is a necessary part of our society. Others share that being able to purchase items that make them happy is something positive in a bleak world. Whiles these points are valid, moving ourselves further and futher in to materialistic tendencies is going to inevitable harm our connections with other, more important aspects of life. Being able to connect with iothers on a personal level, raising families, and enjoying moments in life. Purchasing items for our enjoyment helps us to improve our lives, but should not be considered the ebd all.

At the end of the day, hte world that we have created requires some level of materialism. We need to sell our time in order to pay for life, and  we need to purchase items in order to advance our economy and ensure that others are able to provide for their own. While the average person does not necessarily deserve criticism for participating in materialistic ventures,those who spend all of their time and energy focusing solely on these pursuits should reconsider these pursuits in order to focus on the important aspects of life

5,HAPPINESS,"Those who believe that happiness is achieved by fulfilling personal hopes, dreams, and goals are limiting themselves to a shallow form of satisfaction. It is certainlyeasier to please one's self than to serve humanity; however, the rewards of looking beyond self-centered desires make the amount of extra effort well worth the expediture. There is no down side to serving others: By doing so, the world becomes a better place, and the individual benefits from having a life well-lived.
In contrast, those choosing to live according to what brings individual ""happiness"" may very well discover that, at the end of their life, they have nothing meaningful to show for the years spent on earth. Material gains and self-centered pleasures will seem hollow and insignificant when viewed in the perspective of a lifetime of greed. Furthermore, those who made the decision to serve themselves will also likely find themselves without meaningful relationships; indeed, they may find themselves utterly alone instead of surrounded by loving family and friends. Embitterment will be inevitable as they ponder what could have been, what might have been, if they had chosen a different road.

6,COMPETITION,"Sucess. This is a word that many people know, but not a lot of people can reach. Sucess is term in which a person feel as though they have to reach, in any facet of life. From obtaining a job, purchasing a vehicle, a home, or even satrting a relationship with somenone that lot of people would love to be with, sucess is a term that can have many different meanings. So, to answer the question of whether sucess is better archeived through competition or cooperation, I choose cooperation.

In a world that is constantly revolving, cooperating with other like-minded individuals lead to more lasting accomplishments. In my opinion, in order to become competitive, one must collaborate in order to have a higher probability of success by themselves. A great example of this Lincoln Heights, ohio. the Isley Brothers have been in the music industry, dating back to 1954, and have always stayed together, in order to acheive success through their catalog of singles, ""shout,"" made them realize that cooperation, and collaboration will alwaya bring success, a well as competition from other musicians.

On the other hand, we do live in a competititve society. A great example of this is interviewing for a particular job. Most, if not all people realizee that they are not the only one that is being interviewed by a company for that particular job. We tailor our resumes, and practice answering potential interview qestions as we can , in order to do one thing: stand out from the other candidates. In the greatest of terms, competition is a concept that applies to all of us, but not all of us have to compete in order to achieve sucess.

In conclusion, cooperation has a bigger impact when it comes to achieving success. Whether it is a major project at work, or a college essay to finish, having an extra person or two involved leads to quicker, and better results. Not only does it allow for people to work together, but is also helps each other achieve success. In cooperation, everyone is a winner.","Success.

7,MATERIALISM,"Being materialistic creates division between people based on what they own. We look down on those that don't have the nice house, the nice clothes, the expensive car. But should we judge a person and react to them negatively just because they don't own all the nice shiny things? Does this make them any less of a person? I don't think so. You can have all the best things in the world, but that doesn't mean that you are a good person or a better member to the society as a whole. Modern society should focus less on being materialistic and support the society as a whole instead of only caring for individualistic wants.

We need materials to survive, and yet as a society I believe that we are too controlled by material possessions. When you rely on possessions to provide satisfication, you begin to lose sight of family and friends. Highly materialistic people tend to be competitive and ruthless to get what they want. They begin to lose touch with their compassion for others and can lose intimacy with those closest to them because of where they put others as a priority.

You could argue that we need materials to live our daily lives, and without them we would not be able to function. I would agree that we could not live without such things as cars, houses, clothes, phones, etc. But is a $50,000 car really necessary? Do you need to live in a million dollar house with 20 rooms that you never use? Yes we need materials, but we do not need expensive things to live happy lives. We do not need a divide of those that have material things, and those are lacking in finances to buy the material things.

In conclusion, materials are important to life but not what's most important and it can not guarantee happiness. As a society we have become obsessed with our posessions, and care less about the well-being of others. Our relationships with others are what it is really important.

8,HAPPINESS,"I feel that happiness comes from focusing on one's personal goals. I believe this because when someone achieves their goals, they feel fulfilled and can look back and say that they accomplished what they set out to do. Doing this gives them purpose and meaning in life. It also makes them a more productive member in society.

When people focus on the happiness of others, they may feel jealous or angry that others are getting the rewards they deserve. As human beings, we are naturally selfish and flawed. Unfortunately, it is a challenge to live one's life completely selfless without feeling resentment. However, this doesn't mean one has to live a totally selfish life either. One can live a morally good life focusing on one's goals while still helping others.

Here is an example of what I mean. When I was younger, I did a little prowrestling on the independent circuit. The object of prowrestling is to choreograph fighting to entertain the audience. The winners and losers are predetermined, but the people in the main events make more money. When I started wrestling, I was following my goal, which made me happy. I listened to the people who wrestled longer than me and learned what to do and not do in the ring. I also learned from the advice I was given in terms of how to carry myself outside of the ring. This advice helped me to become more and more successful over a period of time. After I wrestled for a little bit and moved up to the main event, I was then very willing and able to return the favor and help the younger guys who were just starting by giving them the same advice I had been given. Therefore, I was able to help them achieve success as well.

To sum everything up, I would remind people that they only live once. It's most important to do what's right. However, one should focus on their own goals in order to be happy as well. Being happy doesn't mean being selfish. It just means making the most out of what someone was given in life so they can be the best in their chosen field.","I feel that happiness comes from focusing on one's personal goals.

9,MATERIALISM,"Materialism is a huge problem in modern society, today. People tend to think it is meaningful and a way to provide happiness, when in all reality, that just is not true. It causes more harm than it does good. Modern society should be criticized for being materialistic because it does more harm than good.

Being materialistic does nothing to teach our youth how to save and spend money wisely. It is teaching the younger gerneration bad ways of handling money which is not setting a good example for them when they get older. When you are materialistic, you buy things that you want and not things that you need. By doing this you are setting yourself up for failure and running out of money at the cost of just buying what you want.

Material things are just that. They are things. If you come from a rich family or have a lot of money, normally you have more things than you really do need. How does that make anyone truly happy? It doesn't. Maybe it does in the moment. But, it does not in the long run. You are not able to truly enjoy what you have when you are constantly buying things sue to being materialistic.

What about someone that does not have a lot of money or that comes from a poorer family? These people sometimes revert to stealing to try to keep up with the materialistic people of the world. They think they need these that others have in order to fit in. There only hope in having these things, a lot of the time, is to steal them. If not stealing they work and use the money they need for bills on stuff that doesn't truly matter.

To sum it up, materialism or being materialistic is not a good thing. There is more harm that comes form being materialistic than there is good that comes from it. Because of this, modern society should be critized when it comes to materialism.

10,HAPPINESS,"Happiness is not really something that has an objective measure. People can judge their own happiness,  but when looking at another person's they do not have the full perspective. And people may not know what will make them happy untill it does. Obviously, events in a person's life can add to or subtract from their happiness, but their personality is also a factor. Thus, happiness is not  a one-size-fits-all concept. What makes one person happy make make another miserable, and maybe a third person will be relatively unaffected emotionally.

However, many people would likely say that being able to pursue their own goals does contribute to thier happiness. It may not only be in the achievement of a personal goal, but in the pursuit of the goal and in the freedom of making that pursuit that happiness lies. Many people have at least some focus on themselves, as they should, and going after thing that are important to them would seem to lead to, at the very least, satisfaction.

Now, since happiness is subjective, social scientists rely on self-reporting to judge happiness. There are some stimuli that do light up pleasure centers of the brain or release hormones that can affect emotional response, but long-term continous studies on a large enough pool of subjects to prove that pursuing a life goal would make more people happier than focusing on others doesn't seem practical. But there are studies that being able to choose what thet want can cause people to report satisfaction and happiness.

Now, focusing on others and trying to improve humanity is, of course, a worthy goal. It is one that many would find fulfilling. But this could absolutely count as a personal goal, especially if they do find it fulfilling. These two concepts are not truly in conflict with each other.

Happiness is individual and up to each individual to determine for themselves what makes them happy. But getting to do what a person wants to do should make that person happy, however their focus is aimed.","Happiness is not really something that has an objective measure.  People can judge their own happiness, but when looking at another person's, they do not have the full perspective.  And people may not know what will make them happy until it does.  Obviously, events in a person's life can add to or subtract from their happiness, but their personality is also a factor.  Thus, happiness is not a one-size-fits-all concept.  What makes one person happy make make another miserable, and maybe a third person will be relatively unaffected emotionally.

However, many people would likely say that being able to pursue their own goals does contribute to their happiness.

20,COMPETITION,"Competition versus cooperation. The comparison is a competition in itself. While some believe cooperation drives success more so than competition, one must look at the measure of success being determined. On a personal level, competition drives success and as by-product, success of the overall group or entity is increased as well. While cooperation drives the overall success of the group or entity and not the personal success of individuals as they are melded together as a group and may not be recognized for their individual successes.

Competition naturally drives those participating and seeking to win to be successful. Competitors put forth their greatest effort to win. Thereby, the success of the individuals as well as the organization are typically pushed further than done by cooperation. One may argue that without cooperation, the efforts of highly motivated competitors may not be as successful. However, the innate drive to be the best can even be found in cooperative environments where all individuals strive to creates success at all.

In conclusion, while cooperation does offer some motivation for success, it is competition which makes people strive to be the best even within a cooperative environment. Success is measured by becoming the best or winning at somthing, the very nature of success is competitive. There simply is no such thing as success without competition.","     Competition versus cooperation.  The comparison is a competition in itself.  While some believe cooperation drives success more so than competition, one must look at the measure of success being determined.  On a personal level, competition drives success and as a by-product, success of the overall group or entity is increased as well.  While cooperation drives the overall success of the group or entity and not the personal success of individuals as they are melded together as a group and may not be recognized for their individual successes. 

     Competition naturally drives those participating and seeking to win to be successful.  Competitors put forth their greatest effort to win.  Thereby, the success of the individuals as well as the organization are typically pushed further than done by cooperation. One may argue that without cooperation, the efforts of highly motivated competitors may not be as successful.  However, the innate drive to be the best can even be found in cooperative environments where all individuals strive to stand out among the pack.  It is the competitive drive that creates success at all.

24,COMPETITION,"In our world, people approach success in different ways. Some people believe that the best way to be successful is collaborate, while others believe that competition is the best road to success. In this essay, we eill explore this theme and explain why, while competition may yield short-term success, collaboration is likely to lead to long-term results.

Competition is a powerful force in human dynamics. The internal drive to succeed, to dominate, to be the best is part of the human experience. Everyone loves to win, and a strong rivalry or competitive environment can drive individuals to success. But for every winner, there has to be a least one loser (if more).

In contrast, collaboration leads to long-term success for a team of people. While this success may not come as quickly as in a competitive environment, or feel as viscerally satisfying, it is ultimately a success shared by all participants. In addition, when more people are invited to work together and succeed, the resulting success benefits from diverse perspectives and skillsets.

Competition is compelling. It is sexy. To compete and win is one of our fundamental human desires. But the success resulting from competition is short-lived, as it relies on a single individual to carry the torch. By collaborating with others, many hands lighten the load.

Ultimately, I believe that collaborating is likely to lead to more enduring success. A single ruler is only as strong as her rule, but a parliament of leaders can work to counteract one another's weaknesses and create true, lasting success.","In our world, people approach success in different ways.

I am not an expert when it comes to achieving happiness. My personal experiences have led me to believe that pursuing my own dreams and goals leads to my own happiness. No one is happy all the time, but we can learn to find happiness through our own achievements. For example, when I graduated from a college I was happy necause I had fulfilled an important goal I set for myself. When I went further and got a master's degree, I was even happier because I proved to myself that I could study, work hard and do things I promised myself I would. I also graduated with an ""A"" average in every class I took. It felt good to do this and made me happy.

Everyone's definition of happiness is different. There isn't only one way to achieve happiness, just as there isn't only one way to achieve your goals. Maybe helping someone else will help you achieve a goal of your own along the way. It is up to every individual to figure out what makes them happy. No one else can do that for you. Try following your own goals and helping others, then see which one makes you happier.",3.5,0.990442055

32,COMPETITION,"People achieve more in life because of competition. Cooperation can be used to some limited successes, but the true achievements in life come when someone is in competition with others.

The main reason that competition is the motivating factor for success is because it's the law of nature. There really isn't much need to go any further than this to be honest. It's the only reason that is needed to prove this point. Competition is what will motivate any living being on planet Earth to do things that are needed to be done. There is an inherit drive in all of us to compete in order to surive. We want to win. If we can't compete we lose. Competition is the driving force that pushes people to succeed. Take a look at sports for a good example of how this works. People are lined up to run a marathon. They know they are going to have to compete with everyone else. If they want to win the race they are going to have dig deep and compete like they have never done before. Sure, they can cooperate during the race by sitting behind other runners who are in front of them. Then, when the opportunity arises, they start to kick so that they can push ahead. They only cooperated as a means to compete, to take advantage of the other runner with the goal to ahiceve the victory. Competition is what drove them to use the other runner, then dump them when the opportunity was right.

Some will argue that cooperation is what makes people achieve things in life. That might be true to some extent, but, it is not a big enough force to really achieve anything of note. When people are comfortable, not feeling like they need to compete to survive, they get lazy. This laziness doesn't accomplish anything. Cooperation only goes so far. Competition is the true driving force that brings the best out in people.

So, in order for people to really achieve anything meaningful in life there must be competition. Without it and there is no drive, no hunger to do anything.","People achieve more in life because of competition.

After all, much of our economy depends on producing objects which are not crucial to survival, or to creating in order to live.

Such a simplified lifestyles would result in many people losing their jobs, or being forced to go without necesities.

41,MATERIALISM,"Everyone in the world is looking for something else. There always sees to be something we need in our life that we're striving for. Since the dawn of time we have been told that greed is wrong, yet we continue to want more and more things. We should not feel bad for the way we are as guilt accomplishes nothing and only causes issues. It is human nature to want to provide for ourselves and therefore we should not feel bad about desiring more things.

This idea can be as simple as looking at animals in the wild. They do not live a luxurious lifestyle by our standards. They live guided by an intense, urgent drive to survive. This push is so strong that they are willing to do acts that humans would think of as unacceptable. They attack another living creature and tear it apart while it's still alive. This is really a horrible act when we think about it, but they can not deny it because their survival instinc is stronger than anything else. Animals also have no qualms about taking resources such as food and shelter from their neighbors. This is all based on a primal drive that keeps them alive. Human beings are also driven by a similar drive, although we are insistent on attempting to deny what we really are.

Many people would say that humans and animals are different. It is our conscience that separates us from the animals and makes us into higher beings who are capable of superior behavior. One only needs to look at the behavior of an average house per to see the fault in this logic. dogs are animals and yet they obviously experience many of the same emotions that humans do. When their owner has caught them doing something naughty, one look at their face is all the proof you need to know that these animals know what it means to fel guilty. When you spend more time cuddling with one dog and another notices, you can definitely see obvious signs of jealousy taking over tour sad pup's face. These are not emotions that are based solely on a survival instinct. These are the same emotions that we claim animals don't experience. They are capable of experiencing emotions and making decisions on a higher level, but the survival drive is still always present beneath the surface just as it is with us humans.

What we can learn from all creatures, animal or not, is tha ll of our behavior takes place for a reason. Due to the perils of nature it was necessary that we be created with an insatiabe drive to survive. We can witness this by watching the most untamed wildlife or your tightlywound neighbor bill who always buttons his top shirt button. worrying about our wants and desires will only cause us counterproductive guilt and shame that will keep us from moving forward and making positive changes. We must admit that there are certain basic truths about the world that we just can't cjange. Humans have accomplished so much but we can't stop what is inherently within all of us. We can't move forward until we learn to yield to and have a healthy respect for nature.","Everyone in the world is looking for something else. There always seems to be something we need in our life that we're striving for. Since the dawn of time we have been told that greed is wrong, yet we continue to want more and more things. We should not feel bad for the way we are as guilt accomplishes nothing and only causes issues. It is human nature to want to provide for ourselves and therefore we should not feel bad about desiring more things. 

This idea can be as simple as looking at animals in the wild. They do not live a luxurious lifestyle by our standards. They live guided by an intense, urgent drive to survive. This push is so strong that they are willing to do acts that humans would think of as unacceptable. They attack another living creature and tear it apart while it's still alive. This is really a horrible act when we think about it, but they can not deny it because their survival instinct is stronger than anything else. Animals also have no qualms about taking resources such as food and shelter from their neighbors. This is all based on a primal drive that keeps them alive. Human beings are also driven by a similar drive, although we are insistent on attempting to deny what we really are. 

Many people would say that humans and animals are different. It is our conscience that separates us from the animals and makes us into higher beings who are capable of superior behavior. One only needs to look at the behavior of an average house pet to see the fault in this logic. Dogs are animals and yet they obviously experience many of the same emotions that humans do. When their owner has caught them doing something naughty, one look at their face is all the proof you need to know that these animals know what it means to feel guilty. When you spend more time cuddling with one dog and another notices, you can definitely see obvious signs of jealousy taking over your sad pup's face. These are not emotions that are based solely on a survival instinct. These are the same emotions that we claim animals don't experience. They are capable of experiencing emotions and making decisions on a higher level, but the survival drive is still always present beneath the surface just as it is with us humans. 

What we can learn from all creatures, animal or not, is that all of our behavior takes place for a reason. Due to the perils of nature it was necessary that we be created with an insatiable drive to survive. We can witness this by watching the most untamed wildlife or your tightly-wound neighbor Bill who always buttons his top shirt button. Worrying about our wants and desires will only cause us counterproductive guilt and shame that will keep us from moving forward and making positive changes. We must admit that there are certain basic truths about the world that we just can't change. Humans have accomplished so much but we can't stop what is inherently within all of us. We can't move forward until we learn to yield to and have a healthy respect for nature.    ",3.5,0.993362098
42,HAPPINESS,"What is happpiness? Some believe we are trained from early in life to develop and mold our talents so that we can help other people, while others think it's perfectly fine to focus on one's own satisfication, emotional and spiritual growth, and success in socirty and in life.

They have the wealth and power in place already, and can do whatevere they want: it's assumed they find happiness without abtocles that other,ordinary people, enconter and deal with. The rest of us go to school, get jobs, and form association so we may have a solid foundation on which to explore talents personal interests and/or pursuits.

This life course could be self-selrving, for example being aworld-renounces video gaming prodigy. It could be totally altruistic, being a nun in a poor community in India, helping the sick and underpriveleged. Many of us consciously or without intent, do a combination of these, becoming a teacher because they love developing young minds and sharing knowledge while helping each child they teach, or being an emergency room nurse, going above and beyond the ""job duties"" of a nature to help save lives and lessen human suffering. It's impossible to say that a person only does one or the other to increade their happiness: human interact with oother humans, and every single personn has an effects on at least one other person, whether they mean to or not.

46,MATERIALISM,"There are people on both sides of the spectrum when it comes to materialism. In today's society people are pretty materialistic and I don't really see that as a negative thing. There's the saying that things are just things and you shouldn't rely on them to make you happy. It's also true that once you die, none of those things will matter. I just don't see what the problem is with enjoying material things while we are still here.

Manking has come very long way from the Stone Age because of innovations and the evolution of ideas. Material things are not the most important things in life but if you want to work hard to acquire materialistic things while you can then I say do it! I don't see why it should be criticized. I think people should live as they wish as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else.

My reasoning comes from having materialistic things but also, at times, not having been able to enjoy material things. At different times in My life I've had to stick to spending money only on the bare necessities. It's okay, I haven't died from not being able to spend my money freely. I have been happy without being able to spend my money on material things. I can say that, during those hard times, I worked hard to be able to get to that place again where I could spend money on those things. I've had a car that is okay and I've wanted to trade it for a more luxurious one. I don't need it but I would prefer to have more comfortable seats and a smoother ride with colder AC. That's just what I like.

Family and friends are important. Having meaningful experiences is definitely very important. Whether you spend money on materialistic things or not shouldn't take away from that. I think you can have it all if you choose to and you're able to. If spending money on things makes someone happy then I say more power to them.

I think that we have one life to live and we should do things that fulfill us. It's not going to look the same for everybody. It doesn't have to. I think there's a balance in life, a little bit of everything. I think if something is out there, there's someone who's going to want it. There's also someone who won't and that's okay to. For those people that are minimalistic, if that's what they want to do then they should. I don't think anyone has the right to make someone else live like them.

I think at an early age most of us have goals we set into play but some take a different route while others stay on track and execute what we've planned to do our whole life and this is why those who take the wrong way of life just end up unhappy and become jealous of what others accomplish. If I can be happy for others who set out goals and make it in life, then I can be happy for myself. Self motivation is all it takes plus the people whose routing for us is also the key to happines and setting our goals so we could be truly happy.

 I'm hoping someone out here takes this serious and once you set your goals, go with your move. Remember everyone's path to happiness is different. ",3.5,0.992718447
51,HAPPINESS,"The subject is happiness and how we, individually, come about it. Happiness can be different things to different people. Some people find their happiness in helping others, or feeling their own happpiness from pleasing others. Others are very goal oriented about their happiness, only thinking about how it will make them happy after some effort, only thinking about themselves. 

In order to see happiness ahead, you have to be a bit of an optimist. Most pessimists are pretty grumpy because they cannot see a path to happiness, and that is sad. We all know someone, or have met someone, who is just an unhappy person, always finding the down-side of a situation. This is where the rebuttal comes in because people find happiness in different places and for different reasons, but it depends on that person and their personalo outlook in life. Of course, some have been dealt a hardshhip, like poverty, disabilities or violence in their lives, and that can make it very difficult to find any happiness. 

Some can find happiness in the little things in life like seeing and staring at a beautiful, lone, buttercup in a field of weeds or the look of surprise on a child's face when they see their new puppy. I believe happiness comes with some degree of thankfulness, as well. If you are thankful for all that you have and have been blessed with, then you can be happy and content in your heart. By giving thanks, it creates a happiness because it forces you to find some goodness in your life.

52,HAPPINESS,"What makes someone happy? Can you achieve happiness doing just whatever you love, or is it the selflessness that one may showcase from helping others that truly makes someone happy? In this essay I will explore what it is, that helps us reach happiness.

Achieving happiness in life is arguably the main, or maybe even the only goal one can have. Happiness is an intangible concept but it is something that everyone has experienced and can understand. The special thing about happiness is that it does not follow any rules, what makes someone happy will not necessarily make another person happy aswell, but at the same time, just someone being happy can in fact make someone else happy too by itself. For these reasons I think there is no objective way to achieve happiness for any people, the only way it can be achieved is to find your own path to reach it. You have to live life and go along with the flow, and along the way recognise what it truly is that you enjoyed about it.

Many people claim it is impossible to reach true happiness unless you share that joy with others. In my personal opinion, while that may be true, it all boils down once again to everyone doing what they want to. In a strange way, even the act of helping others is inherently a selfish endeavor. When you really think about it, the only reason you do anything is because you want to. Sure it may not feel like it, for example when you say ""I don't want to pay taxes"", but in reality you do want to do it, because you know the alternative would be worse off for you, so you want to avoid that outcome for your own sake. This is the same with helping other, you do it because you want to help others, because it made you feel good and it made you feel happy, no one physically forced you to do any of these, you made the choice willingly.

In conclusion, finding happiness is a difficult task, a task that everyone has to figure out on their own, but overall I think happiness is more likely to come when you focus on yourself, doing what you want.","What makes someone happy?

When we focus on what to do to make us happy, confusion may play apart if happiness is not easily obtained. So, how do we fulfill our happiness without thinking about it or trying to plan out what to do to achieve that?

When we wake up in the morning, it's always the goal to live out the best parts of the day and to be as happy as we can be. We plan out the day, whether that includes work or not, and we try to avoid anything not positive that can inflict on our happiness. What if you planned that date you've been waiting on with the partner of your dreams, just for them to cancel last minute without a reason? That could in turn hurt the happiness aspect of the day. What if everything you planned went wrong or something drastic happens? These things can really hurt our happiness.

However, I've realized that regardless of what I plan or how eager I am to be happy, things happen. Happiness from within has many aspects. If everything is going wrong in your life, hoe is it even possible to be happy, right?

Have you ever sat on a bench outside at the park and saw two children playing and enjoying their moments? How did it make you feel? Even in times of darkness or just plain unhappiness, the joy of seeing other people happy, especially children, outweighs any bad.

If there's ever a time when you can't find that bit of happiness you're looking for, maybe stop looking for it, or just stop trying to find it within. Happiness comes with happy things and happy thoughts that can't be achieved being selfish.

When people work alone, they only have their own talents to relay on. For instance, I recently completed in a writing contest, wherever we entrends were provided with a genre, location and assigned item. While I think I'm a good writer, and I've scored well in previous competitions,I'm also aware that I have some areas where I need major improvement.

I thought the book came out better than anything I could have written alone as others were strong in setting scenes and describe things. Likewise, I was able to fill in where others struggled with dialogue and humour. All of this is to say that when someone falls, with cooperation, someone else can pick them up and help them to carry on or to even continue the race for them, like in relay races(through the letter is generally minus falling).

Some people might argue that they would be, but I think many people try to find their happiness in the things that they purchase.

However, if these employees were encouraged to work together to brain storm how productivity can be increased together, it would certainly be interesting to see how outcomes would compare. I would expect that the results would be similar, if not better, than working in a competitive environment. Overall, people do achieve greater success through cooperation rather than through competition. This has also been shown in other countries, specifically in Europe, that are much less competition-driven than the United States; when societies are built with more of a community focus rather than an individual focus, health, happiness, and well-being outcomes are improved across the board for citizens.",3.5,0.947556615
61,MATERIALISM,"In today's world, people are driven to make more money so they can spend it. Many people are constantly looking for higher paying jobs so they can afford to buy huge houses and spend more money on cars, clothes, and other things. People love to buy high brand items and are quick to turn their nose at reusing others' gently used items. I think modern society should be criticized for being too materialistic.

In today's world there are so many thrift store options or utilizing a local town's buy/sell trade forums to help cut down on the production of more items that aren't always necessary. But I constantly see so many people think they're ""too good"" to shop at Goodwill or to buy their neighor's things at a yard sale. If people would be less focused on ""brand new"" items then they would see that there are perfectly good usable options for what ends up being less than half the cost most of the time. I used to collect pins from Disney. In that community I constantly see people fighting over being the first ones to buy the new pins so they can add to their collection. This leads to items selling out so quickly because there is a low stock. Then I see many people turn around and re-sell them for over double the original price because they know that people will be desperate enough to pay those high prices. People can only think about buying the brand new item even though it most likely will end up sitting on their display board taking up space. I also see it a lot in the bamboo clothing community. People are constantly rushing to buy new bamboo pajamas for their children without actually needing them. I've seen people who only joined the community a month or two ago and have already bought over 40 pairs of pajamas for their kids just because they ""couldn't say no"" to buying more. It becomes a complusion for people to buy the next new print even if they don't necessarily like it. I also see many people selling their unused or gently used pajamas for more than triple the price because it's a ""limited edition"" or hard to find print and they know people will spend upwards of $100 just to say they own it.

There is a small movement of people who are trying to focus on experiences instead of presents for children on their birthdays. I love this movement and want to try and implement if with my daughter as she grows up! The memories from experiences like going to the aquarium or on a vacation will be more fullfilling to our family's relationship than if I buy her a bunch of toys for her birthday. However, I know that some people think it's okay to be materialistic because spending money brings them joy. Finding the exact item they're looking for and being able to afford can make someone very happy! But usually that leads to wanting more things and then more things and eventually they'll never stop looking for the next thing. It also won't bring them true joy because that comes from human connection, not items. If people focused on other ways to spend their money that could benefit themselves or their family instead of spending it on useless material items then I think people would be happier overall. I definitely think today's society is too materialistic and people need to think more about what they actually need to spend their money on instead of just buying anything they think they want.","In today's world, people are driven to make more money so they can spend it.

63,COMPETITION,"Cooperation vs. Competition? Some would argue the former is better for the individual and society while others would argue the latter is. Many claim competition brings out the best in them, but that argument is problematic since earth has billions of inhabitants and competition usually is behavior trait which strives to benefit the indivdual above all others.

God made human beings to be in community and cooperate with one another. If competition were to be king that would mean every society, every community, every work space, religious space, etc. would constantly be the individual vs. everyone else and total chaos would ensue. To ensure a functioning society we must share resources and working cooperatively together brings multiple perspectives to tacle complex problems which increases the likliehood of solving said problem. If one is always competing against co-workers, neighbors, strangers, etc. stress levels stay high and productivity will decrease over time. So constant competition wears on mental and physical health and strains relations with others. We are designed to work together cooperatively in give and take throughout life to get things done and benefit as many people as possible and to maintain a stable society.

History shows us that successful civilizations were built on cooperation. The United States is an example as people from different backgrounds and walks of life came together fought/won against the British and collaboratively formed a new government and the country is approaching 250 years of existence. This would not have happened if it was simply competition without cooperation.

I believe people achieve more success by cooperation than competition. Competition definitely fuels the drive to do better and be better, but these are not lasting successes. For instance, something simple like a weightloss journey between two people. Person A and Person B are completing to see who loses the most weight in X amount of time. Person A falls short, and Person B wins. Is the success in beating out the other person? Beating out the other person is a short-term success. That win lasts only an instant. On the other hand if Person A and Person B were to work together and encourage each other on this weigh loss journey, the success to a healthier lifestyle may last longer than the success of simply winning.

On the other hand, competition also plays in as a factor to success. People strive to do better and be better when there is something to ""win."" For example, look at the capitalistic society we live in today. What drives this success? Companies constantly compete with one another to come up with the best new innovative product. That win is short-lived because the next company can come up with another new innovative item the next day.

When I had some overwhelming life crisis, I had to help a friend in crisis at the same time. The results were that I worked through my issues by helping my friend work through hers. We became even closer and it has been a source of satisfaction for me, a sense of accomplishment for getting through my situation and watching my friend grow in confidence.

She had been focused on her situation at the exclusion of family and friends and was getting more depressed. I had been focused on how to remedy my adverse situation and was not getting anywhere. When her situation presented itself to me, it wasn't a direction that I wanted to go at the time, but she needed my help immediately. It just was the right thing to do.

By focusing on my friend's situation I put my issues in the background. I found at the end of the day that, when her situation improved, I was happy for her and I was happier and able to move forward again along with my friend.",3.5,0.964956195
71,COMPETITION,"When handling challenges, humans are given two choices: work together, or fight to win. We all have a tendency to want to be the best, however, most times we find the most successful outcome lies when we share the win. Cooperation for a greater goal far outshines choosing to compete alone for the glory.

It is often said that ""two heads are better than one"". The reason this is such a common knowledge quote is because the evidence of cooperation exists through history and through daily life. In work, in sports, and in social activity, we achieve greatness as a society by working together. Cooperation is the very foundation that modern society has been built upon. It can be said that conflict and competition can light a fire in our souls to be better, to be the best we can be. While this can be true for many individuals, it doesn't necessarily drive them to do better on a larger scale. Many times, competition is rooted in selfishness. When we want to win, we want to win ourselves and not for everyone. On the contrary, when we factor in the goals of everyone involved, innovative solutions are found. We grow and learn together; as families, as teams, as countries, as a global community.

Success is born when we as humans choose to put aside our differences and join forces to solve problems. This is innately true through history and in all facets of life.

72,HAPPINESS,"""Pursuit of  happiness"" is a phare I heard often growing up. I didn't understand it most of the time. As a child there are many things that brings you happiness; your mother's embrace after a long day at school, you father combing your hair , your siblings all laughing and crowding in the living room playing video games together. Toys, games, friends, going to your favorite restaurant on a saturday morning, holidays, grandparents, the park.Growing up, I was a very happy kid.
As I've gotten older, I've learned that happiness is easier to obtain than others believe-but it can also become elusive. Many times as adults we are stressed about the state of our world, both individually and as a society. Consumerism makes up believe that happiness lies in ""things"". The harder you work, the more money you'll get, the more things you buy and therefore the happier you are.
Happiness is an every changing state of being. It's an emotion, a goal, a ""pursuit"". Happiness can ciome from our actions, such as a dream or personal goals. Iy can come instrically or from external forces. There is no one right way to be happy, but I do believe there are things that can be done that bring more happiness to you.
There is a phrase thets says ""You can't pour from an empty cup."" I believe that people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their own self, their desires, their goals. I believe that this has to happen alongside others, though. No one person is ever truly alone, and having family and supportive friends will make your journery more memorable. if you're too focused on the happiness of others or of making other people's goals happen, you are likely to lose your sense of self and lose sight of personal goals. People can take advantage of you, projects can fail to lift off the ground, and you could be left not knowing what to do when the goal is achieved.
I think being a tad selfish is ok. It's important to help your fellow man and your community. But your happiness should come first. You won't be able to help other people in vulnerable situations if you are stresssed or depressed. Your health can be affected as well. 
All that said, happiness is never guaranteed. But it can also be found anywhere and at anytime. Now as an adult, I have sparks of happiness throughout my day in the form of text conversations, a nice lunch, getting home at a decent hour, a package at my doorstep, saying hello to my neighbors. If focus on my goals and pursue them free of fear of what I ""should"" do. When I'm well rested and have time off, I try my best to volunteer in my commmunity. I find organizztions that I believe in and donate my time or money to help them out . I wouldn't be able to do such things if I was too focused on something or someone else. I've been taken advantage of in the past and told that I need to scrifice my self for the sake of others. During that period of my life, I ws unwell, both physically and mentally.I was struggling financially and was trying to find a way out.
Now I have boundaries towards where I focus my efforts and my overall health has improved. I was able to achieve some londstanding goals of mine and that accomplishment ushered in a new period of happiness and wellbeing in my life.

74,MATERIALISM,"The prompt I read was about ""Materialism"" specifically, ""Should modern society be criticized for being materialistic?"" Being 76 years old and having the experience I have had, I find that it's all about how one is raised. My home as a child was lower, working class and I can rememner seeing the check that dad brought home one week, in the amount of $86. That was the amount Mom, dad, my brother, sister and I had to live on. But this was the 1950s and to be quite honest, there was no complaining, we made do with what we had. Not too long ago, my wife, mentioned that her Mom used to reuse the aluminim foil that she used. She would unwrap it from how she used it, smooth it out and then reuse it, when the time came.

Of course, as I advanced in life, I found that the more I made, the more I could afford different things. But having been raised as I was, I felt I was wise enough to place my priorities on necessities. There were savings of course, which were used for special occasions or maybe a bit of a vocation once a year, or for emergencies. This especially when I had a family of my own, which started when I was right out of the military at age 22. But I do understand materialism, there are always things we'd like to have and buy, but the quetion has to be asked, ""can I afford that?"" I've heard of situations too where, say for instance, a wife and husband may not be on the same page as far as spending and that can certainly put stress on a relationship, or a family in general, which naturally is sad. But I guess it's something that should be talked about beforehand.

So back to the question, should modern society be criticized for being materialistic? My thoughts are that it's up to each and every individual, their situation in life, their values and their responsibilities. ""Society"", which to me means the ""whole"" can express itself in any way it wishes, it's up to the individual to accept how and what is presented to them any way they wish.

75,COMPETITION,"Cooperation vs competition. They are both very important in achieving success whether in business, sports, everyday life.

Competition seems like it would bring you more success than cooperation. When we compete and compare ourselves to others, we can learn to improve our current successes. But competition can also be detrimental, as it can harm a person's confidence in themselves and cause doubt and hospitality towards others.

I believe, cooperation is the true key to success. In order for a team to be successful and win a championship you need players that trust and cooperate with each other. Learning to work with others towards a common goal helps foster social and communication skills and builds trust within team members. Cooperating with others helps in gaining other perspectives and allows you to have a more open mind. Cooperation breeds competition because as you are working towards a common goal you are still trying to compete with someone, whether that be a business, team or another work group.

Overall, most people are driven to compete over cooperating. The happiness that you get from winning a competition, is usaully short lived and unproductive.

Certainly, one must cooperate with the personal trainer and teamates prior to the competition. One must cooperatively wear the uniform, acknowledge the perameters set by organizers, do what and be where instructed. But the end result is reached through the sheer force of individual competition.

If one is working toward a specific professional outcome, be it personal or universal, cooperation with fellow workers is crucial.

Indeed, he may change the trajectory of the company for the worse, just through his own thoughtless deeds in reaching his ambitions and establishing a path others may feel is fine to follow. Conversely, if he reaches his pinacle with the aid and cooperation of others, his coworkers and subordinates feel invested in him and in the company. All for one and one for all.

In conclusion, the purpose of the hoped-for success (personal or shared achievement) determines whether one proceeds through competition or cooperation. ",3.5,0.986892409
81,HAPPINESS,"Everyone derives happiness in different ways and from different sources, but I think most people are more likely to be happy if they focus on the happiness of other people in their lives than on pursuing their own dreams and goals. One might direct happiness-causing actions toward close relatives or best friends, or toward strangers that they help in some way, thus getting satisfaction from doing a good deed for someone without expecting anything in return.

Pursuing one's dreams and reaching one's goals can certainly be a source of happiness for most people and are important ways to achieve fullfilling life. No one would deny someone the satisfaction of landing a dream job, making a lot of money, or achieving fame in one's field. Some people were just not brought up to make other's happiness an important goal or priority, and there is nothing inherently wrong with that.

But for people who selflessly do things for other people, there are few things more satisfying than making another person happy.  This might take the form of relatively minor actions, like doing an errand for someone, or simply letting a loved one know how much you care about them. Or it could be a larger gesture, like donating time or money to a charity. Whatever the action, one cannot help but feel satisfied, fullfilled, or useful when one has increased the happiness, of other person. All you have to do is remember the Golden Rule, and think about how you would feel if someone did something nice for you. You would be appreciative - and feeling appreciated is one of our most basic needs, and a definite key to happiness.

82,MATERIALISM,"When society starts to value materials, owning them and procuring them over the lives of their fellow humans, then yes we should be criticized. Criticizing members of society can be a necessity so they realize where their priorities lay.

If a local school board wants to raise taxes to pay for a high school that is unsafe for the staff and children that go there, they put up a measure. The local tax payers need to review why the tax is necessary, and vote. Some tax payers will complain that they don't even have children, or others will say the tax is too high. Meanwhile, the staff and students are in a 60 year old building full of mold and asbestos. The welfare of these staff members and students should come before the extra few dollars a month that will go towards something the tax payers might not really need but rather, want.

The hope is that if you do not call out society members is that they will realize it on their own. That will come too little and late. Besides putting other people before your materialistic needs, the other thing to take into account is the environment. How much waste is being put out there because you have to have the new phone every year? Even though there isn't much of a change from year to year.

I work hard, just as most people do, and I want to but all types of things that I don't need and might not last long. People in society should ba able to spend their money how they decide. This is a good counterpoint. In America, we have a terrible capitalistic economy. Buy, buy, buy, is the motto. Got to have the brand new thing, or but from this brand to be the cool kid.

I have definitely fallen for feeling that i needed the latest, greatest phone or TV. Did it even truely fulfill anything for me though?

The answer to that is a resounding NO. I feel like people from all different socioeconomic groups fall victim to this parents even buy their kids brand new iphones before 10. This is materialism at its scarist. I dp worry about criticizing people for being materialistic because it comes from a place of lack in their life. People are trying to fill a void.

Some might say there is nothing wrong with acquiring the latest and greatest things. That it drives the economy. If people didn't keep buying these things innovation woildn't move forward and we wouldn't progress as a society. I feel thats a load of hoopla.

If we can compare humans' levels of happiness between current society and pre-materialistic society, we will be able to find out if materialism is driving our society and general levels of happiness downward. If materialism is contributing to people's general unhappiness, it is fair to say that modern society should be criticized for being too materialistic. Material items may be bringing unhappiness to people in many ways, both direct and indirect. Not only does the initial excitement of getting something new wear off quickly, also the manufacturing of these items may be harming our world in ways that are also negative for society. If we stop this push for material goods, hopefully people will be able to find true happiness that relationships and experiences can bring. ",3.5,0.962710084

I feel there is too much emphasis on what we have rather than who we have in our lives.the focus shifted from family to fortune somewhere along the way,and I feel it is important to shift that focus back to family and working together as a society.

We,as a society,put an extreme amount of pressure on ourselves and others to measure our value by our physical posessions.Our real value comes from within and those around us. The leove we carr in our hearts for others,and yhe love they give us in return is much more valuable than anything money can buy. I would gladly trade my physical possessions for the loved ones I have lost. Would you?

If we were to put the entire population standing side by side wearing the exact same gown,with no make up,jewelry,handbags, shoes, or fake hair, could you tell the differrnce between the wealthy and not wealthy? Could you actually consider yourself so different than the person standing next to you? Iwould say the answer is no. The amount of money or material possessions you own does not change who you are in your heart. Loving yourself and others just as we all are is priceless and selfless.Never forget, we all started out helpless in this life.

Humble and kind is what we should all aspire to be.It is ok to treasure material things,but do not let it define who you really are. Enjoy the moments, not the momentos.

94,APPEARANCE,"The issue I've been assigned to address is whether appearances have a greater impact on a person's perceptions of reality than they should.

It has been my observation over time that there is a great deal of validity to the position that images have a powerful influence over people, particularly in how they choose to spend their money. We are constantly bombarded with advertisements wherever we go. The food looks delicious and is beautifully prepared, we have the resort all to ourselves, the beaches are practically empty, and so on. We focus on the dream and want to experience what we see. We can easily envision ourselves in whatever scenario the actors on the screen are portraying. Our critical thinking skills take a back seat when we're enticed by the beauty of that new car. Seldom do we consider that our vacation will not be as nearly as idyllic as the commercial promised it would be.

Since our imagination is so powerful, advertisers will continue to use the power of imagery to entice people to consume their product, although there are some skeptics who will never buy into the hype; these few tend to be older and wiser. In my opinion, the younger the consumer, the more likely they will be to fall for the images without thinking about any potential downside. Human beings really are hedonists at heart, and what better way to lure them into buying your product than having that item or service associated with smiling, beautiful people in enticing, exciting surroundings?

To have a better idea of the amount of material possessions we are acquirinng, you only need to look at storage facilities. We have so much stuff that it won't fit in our house, garage, basement, attic, or even the shed. We need to rent more space for our stuff. Then you have a house in the neighborhood that is just overflowing with stuff, because the people that live there are hoarders. A few houses away, we have a minimalist. They feel that less is more.

100,HAPPINESS,"Are people more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals or on the happiness of others?That is a very good question and one that has a very simple answer in my opinion. That answer is found in The Golden Rule that I am sure we have all heard at least one time in our life.

The Golden Rule states, ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. ""To me, that means we should aways put others ahead of ourselves. When we put others first, we take our eyes off of ourselves and any selfish desires that we may have. When we look out for others and support them with whatever needs they have, then we will begin to feel what true happiness is all about. Getting more for ourselves may bring about a temporary feeling of pleasure but it does not last long. Knowing that you looked beyond your needs or wants to the needs and wants of others bring much more lasting pleasure and happiness.

Some may stay that if we don't take care of ourselves first then we won't have the energy or resources to be able to take care of or help anyone else. I find that answer to have some leverage but overall it does not usually come to fruition when we go that route.Normally, people get too stuck on themselves and trying to get themselves in order that they forget about everything and everyone around them. They get focused on all the trials and struggles they are carrying without anythought of anyone else. Most of the time, the people around them are going through similar struggles, and they could be helping each other along. I have been in this position before. I had many medical issues over the period of about five years. Starting out, I was only thinking of me and how I was gping to get through it and how bad I was feeling. It was never ending and made me very depressed and down in the dumps. I started to realize it was because I was only focusing on myself and my bad situation. Instead of keeping own that road, I began to reach out to others who were having health issues just to let them know that I was thinking of them and understood what they were going through. I started talking to people in the hospital room next to me and found out some of them were a lot worse off than me. Befor long, I had a list of people that I was checking in on and encouraging, and I soon forgot about a lot of my own problems. I found myself feeling better emotionally and mentally, and I truly believe that is what got me out of the depressed state I was in.
   
To be honest, I believe that we should have a good balance in life in all things. From the personal experience I have gained however, I found that I was truly more happy when I was able to help others than when I was helping myself. It goes without saying that we need to take care of ourselves but that does not negate the need for us to be looking out for our fellow man. When life gets tough, we can look around and see those who are having it tougher. There will always be someone out there who has it worse. I think we need to put ourselves a little in the background in life and focus more on being a light and a blessing to those we come in contact with every day. I can promise that slowly but surely, you will sense that inner happiness and peace that comes when you realize that you have been a help and comfort to someone else.
 
In conclusion, the best happiness comes from within not from things or anything external. We should give of ourselves and find that true happiness. Most times it seems that when we do that, we get back a lot more that we ever thought we needed or wanted. So,be focused on others and realize that your true happiness will follow.

It goes without saying that we need to take care of ourselves but that does not negate the need for us to be looking out for our fellow man. When life gets tough, we can look around and see those who are having it tougher. There will always be someone out there who has it worse. I think we need to put ourselves a little in the background in life and focus more on being a light and a blessing to those we come in contact with every day. I can promise that slowly but surely, you will sense that inner happiness and peace that comes when you realize that you have been a help and comfort to someone else. 

In conclusion, the best happiness comes from within not from things or anything external. We should give of ourselves and find that true happiness. Most times it seems that when we do that, we get back a lot more that we ever thought we needed or wanted. So, be focused on others and realize that your true happiness will follow. Prove me right!",3.5,0.993182438

102,APPEARANCE,"Yes, I think that images and impressions absolutely have too much of an effect on people. All you have to do is look around you at any store or at any television commercial. Brightly colored pretty packages are made to attract our attention in order to make a sale. We are conditioned to want to be like celebrities even though they are in reality no better than us. We are told that we should want to be like them, wear the same clothes as them, vacation in the same places they do.

Take the Kardashians as an example. This is a family that got famous for doing nothing other than being rich, yet we are forced to see articles about them in the news and online every day. These people are not anything to aspire to. Why aren't we seeing news about people that are actually making a difference in the world? It is impossible to ignore. I for one do not want my daughter to grow up  thinking that being rich and famous is important. I want her to have her own aspirations and dreams, not what she is being told by the media that she should want.

Politicians are another cesspool. They parade themselves in public as crusaders for all kinds of great causes but what do any of them actually do? Their public persons more often than not don't match the reality. Every day is a new scandal.

As for me, I have seen the same H & M commercial probably 15 times a day for thelast 2 weeks on television. Does it make me want to buy clothing from there? No, it doesn't. If anything it has the opposite effect and makes me want to stay far away and never buy anything from that brand. This is why advertising is not always effective.

103,HAPPINESS,"Feelings of accomplishment and the pride that one gains when reaching a personal goal can easily be confused with happiness, which is why some people feel that their haooiness can only come by focusing on personal goals. True happiness hiwever, is generally found when a person focuses on supporting others and is often found where you might least expect it. Many people have found that they have gone though life completely focuses on the next goal, always replacing each accomplishment with another task. First, then do well on exams , then they graduate college, then they get a job, then they get promoted; each of these accomplishments greater than the next but suddenly they find themselves unhappy. Why is that?
 
It is because true happiness does not come from achieving goals you have set for yourself, rather, it cimes from seeing other do well, succeed, or flourish. A father may feel some pride for a recent promotion at work, but that pride is completely overshsdowed by the pride he feels seeing his son learn to walk or ride a bicycle. It is human nature to be happiest when you are contributing to the well being and success of others. Many people report that working for a non- profit gives them much higher job satisfaction working for a for profit corporation. These people know that it feels good to give back and the sence of accomplishment get from helping others leads to a higher sence of hsppiness. 

As people age, they are all the more likely to find happiness in giving joy to others. This is one reason why grandparents spoil their grandchildren; they have found themselves in a postion where they can afford to do things for others so they do it willingly. They are no longer shackled by the hardships of work and providing for a family so the natural tendency is to do for others because they are wise enough to know that they will enjoy that more than any other behavior, more than achieving any ither goal they may set for themselves personally.

Many people strugglto find happiness; they live their whole lives with a nagging feeling of lack of contenement. I would argue that these people could find what they are looking for by doing volunteer work. I believe they would find great satisfaction in cleaning up a breach, provoding a meal to a homeless person, or visiting the ekderly; and with this feeling of satisfaction would cime the happiness that they seek.

104,COMPETITION,"The following  essay is to achieve a consensus on success. Is it better to be more competitive or to cooperate with others to achieve goals? By going alone do you get more success and thus more rewards? In other words, you will get all the credit while others may claim the credit by cooperation on doing the task. This also depends on how each individual sees success. Answering this question is the theme of this essay.

What is success? Is it fame and fortune? Is it higher pay? Is it self gratifying to be better than others? For each person this could be different and also include all these questions. For myself I believe that success is completing the job and doing it well. If it requires help from others to make sure it is successful then I'm fine with the help. If others later try to hog the credit it will be annoying but the ultimate goal is to succeed and finish the task. In that way we will get paid.

So in conclusion. Success if done alone will make the person take the credit or failure of the task on themselves. The reward could be greater but the risks are even worse if you fail to succeed. In most businesses in this world the usual motto is team. If the team wins the company wins. When the company wins the company gets more work and the team wins. With more work there will be more chances of advancement. There will be more chances of better pay.

Many studies have been done on the effects of advertising and subtle persuasion and how these can alter human preferences.

When taken to these extremes, it's easy to see that these images and impressions are taking too much of a toll. There's also the concern of appearences giving a completely inaccurate depiction of something. Life should involve some healthy skepticism but when impressions reach the point of being actively deceptive, that crosses the line into a flat out lie. It begs the question: How far is too far? And when and who will hold these companies and people accountable if it helps their own bottom line? And most importantly, how do these issues effect more vulnerable populations that may not have the education or resources to independently verify the validity?

For instance, political ads usually focus on style over substance with short blurbs and this can cause the populace to rely on images and not facts to make decisions on their voting. News sites use flashy headlines and photos to get hits on websites (and thus more ad revenue) and there is little in-depth analysis to provide the actual news so instead of people getting facts they may just get commentary from a particular website or newsite.

Many people have joined into this pursuit since it began, with many claiming to have achieved happiness, but interestingly, the method of achieving happiness has been hotly contested. While some people claim that you must focus inward on achieving your own hopes and dreams in order to achieve happiness, others have claimed that you must instead focus outward, on helping as many people as possible. The debate will continue as long as we have the free time to do so, which appears to be for the indefinite future. Personally, I am in the former camp-you must focus on yourself and your own goals in order to become content with your life.

When the covid-19 pandemic hit, I was a senior in college. My parents wanted me to graduate with a degree in engineering and do one of two things: either get a high-paying job, or go to graduate school, which I would have to fund myself. I chose to go to graduate school, but not for the reason you might expect. I have played baseball since I was six years old, and I had continued playing baseball in college. I was upset that my senior year had got cut short due to the pandemic, so I went to graduate school mostly so I could play another year of baseball.  However, as the pandemic wore on, and I progressed remotely through my master's degree program while playing a limited season of baseball, I began to deal with serious mental health issues. I was sick of being stuck in my room I hated the thought of giving up competitive baseball for good once I graduated again, and I had no desire to do as my parents wanted and find a desk job related to my field of study. So, in an act of desperation and rebellion, I began to search for opportunities to extend my baseball career. To my great surprise, I found an oppportunity to play semi-professional baseball in Europe while coaching yout teams at the same time. This opportunity combined three of my greatest joys in life: playing baseball, travelling and working with kids(I have previously had great fun being a camp counselor). While my parents didn't exactly like the idea, they came around because they saw how much this opportunity mant to me. Now, I am preparing to leave for Germany in less than a month, and I am the happiest I have been in a long time. 

My personal experinece is a great example of how focusing on yourself leads to happiness. Before, I was alone in my room, trying too hard to please my parents and do what they and the rest of society said I should do after graduating. This pressure, along with the simple fact that working behind a desk is not what I wanted to do, led to serious mental health issues. However, once I found this opportunity which matched all my hopes and dreams, and I began pursuing what I wanted to do, my mental health improved significantly and quickly. I cannot wait to travel the world, playing and sharing the game I love with kids and adults alike. Without pursuing my own dreams, I would never have been able to have this kind of positive impact. While some may say that you should try and help others, and you will find happiness along the way, I say they've got it backwards-find happiness by doing what you love, and you will inevitably help others along the way.","When we, the human species, first came into existence, we were nomadic and fought to survive.

111,HAPPINESS,"Happiness is more than skin deep.  Many different aspects of happiness and the search for it can be found within yourself.  But, to get to the true root of happiness, you have to set out to help others and treat others with kindness.

Personal goals are the aim in life to try to become something or achieve a certain level of success...or at least attain something.  You can strive to attain a lot of money.  You can try to reach a certain level of success within a company.  You can even try to seek solace in finding satisfaction with personal goals that you get to by using any disposable means you have.  All these things are great things to aim for and achieve.

The real goal should be to help others though because you gain perspective on the plight of others and the struggles they go through.  You also gain insight into the fact that you are not the only one in the struggle.  You may gain friends you never knew or thought you would have.  You may gain knowledge to unanswered personal issues you have had.  You could even find a romantic partner you may never have even considered.

The arguement can be made that it would be monumental in your life to have the biggest, fanciest and most attractive things in life.  But having the experiences with others is much more gratifying.  Think about it like a football team that wins the National Championship.  If the team wins, every player on the team has a memory and an accolade to think about for the rest of their lives.  On the other hand, if the team loses but the QB passes for 500 yards and 5 TD's, the QB is the only one achieving a form of personal success.

In conclusion, the satisfaction you will gain from helping others can manifest itself in many different forms of happiness.  The gain of achieving happiness with others far outweighs the gain of going it alone.","Happiness is more than skin deep.

Sports is the most obvious example. No team sport success can be considered a product of individual competitiveness, but are instead focusing that competitiveness along with a team sharing the same goals and drive. American football has invidual superstars and highly competitive individuals, but every play, from kickoff to field goal is a product of team cooperative behavior, both on offense and defense.

Even sports that seem individualized and maximized for individual competitiveness, like tennis, benefit from cooperation above fierce competitivess. How often do you see a tennis champion thank their team - their coaches, families, etc.? Without their cooperation, and in fact the individual player's cooperation, the champion would not be in the winning position in which they find themselves.

Fierce individual competitivesness has also often been casually linked to a fear of failure but I'd argue that these are also completely different. Begin in terror for your job, for example, doesn't breed competitiveness, but brings toxic and unproductive stress.

I believe that in order to efficiently achieve success, there needs to be a healthy balance between the two- leaning slightly more in the favor of the spirit of cooperation.

Many companies who wish to pursue more efficient success, and can afford to, will turn to consultants to analyze their employees' behavior and performance.  As with most concepts with humans, context is important- factors such as the type of industry they work in, emotional/mental needs of employees, location, etc. all lead to different results and opinions.  However, I believe only by working together towards a common goal will success be achieved.  Humans are social creatures.  Since birth, we rely on others (our parents or guardians) for our survival.  As we grow older, some fall for the misconception that they can do everything alone.  Life was not meant to be lived that way.  However, a healthy balance of competition can encourage constituents to be their best.  They can look at their better-performing peers as inspiration to do and be better.

Cooperation, with a little touch of competition, is the best option to produce significant, lasting success.  We should encourage people to work together because we are social creatures but also encourage some competition so that the inspiration to be better is there.","          Anyone who has ever held or has a leadership position in a company will have at one point wondered how he or she could increase their team's productivity.

While some would say that competition can be helpful and drive to motivate individuals to work harder, be helpful and drive to motivate individuals to work harder, be more creastive, and generally increase performance, I say that the opposite is true. Cooperation is the superior pathway tosuccess, and having a competitive mindset is more harmful than helpful.

Using competition  as a motivator for success is, as its root, based invarious negative emotions: jealousy, rivlary, and fear being just a few examples. These negative  emotions are used a s fuel to push oneself to perform lbetter and achieve the goals at hand. In contrast, when using cooperation as a motivator and tool for success,, the core emotions are positive ones:satisfaction, 
happiness, comradrie. I believe that motivation rooted in positive emotion is not only healthier, but also leads to better results when compared to motivation rooted in negative emotion. In addition, cooperation can lead to more creative ideas and sloutions, because peope are able to bounce ideas off of one another rather than being left to rely only on their own thoughts.

123,MATERIALISM,"Diogenes was one of the first thinkers to completely reject all aspects of material life, choosing to live inside of a barrel and adopt a viewpoint of cynicism. He pursued this way of living back in Ancient Greece, far before the advent of industryand the popularization of commercial goods. While the criticism of materialism seems to be a completely modern discourse, humans have always questioned the value of material goods and their effect on society. However, as commercial production continues to increase rapidly in today's society, the discussion feels more necessary than before. More people should take a deeper look at the sustainability of their spending, and the impact of their choices. While there is nothing wrong with enjoying the pleasantries of modern life, one needs to maintain certain ethics and enjoy responsibly.

Factory production now is higher than it ever has been. Though there are discussions about scarcity and meeting the demands of a growing population, the fact is, we are producting at a surplus. We have more goods than could ever possibly be distributed across evry member of the human race, and yet we continue to produce even more every day - resulting in excess goods (which are usually perfectly fine and usable) being left to rot in landfills. This contributes to a multitude of environmental issues, including land, water, and air pollution. Materialism in and of itself isn't necessarily the problem, it's the way we approach material goods. Moderation is the key - it is possible to have too much of a good thing. Living a luxurious life is one thing, but when that lifestyle comes at the cost of the planet, one needs to reflect and consider if it's truly worth it. Furthermore, owning expensive items is not the key to happiness. So much beauty and fulfillment can come from being in nature and experiencing the world with other people, which is why it is so necessary to maintain a sustainable lifestyle.

Earth is our home, and it is our responsibility to protect it. We have to be mindful about the way we interact with nature, or else we won't have anything to enjoy in the first place. Criticism of materialism should not simply shame people for enjoying modern commodities, it should instead allow them to consider their impact and remind them to be mindful of how they consume. Living a life of excess is not only detrimental to the one doing it, but to the planet and all who inhabit it - human or not.

It's an unfortunate reality that doing so is one of the ways society as a whole judges people, but it's also very real that in this day and age, we've moved beyond just a want for materialistic things. These days, need is just as important.

A large number of people live beyond their means in their attempts to grow their material gain, but an even larger number simply need it to survive.

In this essay I will describe how images and impressions have too much of an effect on people in advertisements, stores, and the media.

Advertisements often leave the viewer with a favorable impression, but little or nothing is said about the actual products. An example of this in popular culture is the holiday television ads that feature cute animals like penguins or polar bears. The commercials will say nothing of the flavor, the price, or any relevent feature of the products, yet most know exactly which product has been referred to here.

Product packaging in stores show the tastiest, larger-that-life versions of the contents inside, often resulting in disappointment by consumers when they are faced with something that looks less appetizing that the front of the box. Japan, notably, has legislation opposing larger pictures than the actual product to prevent such misleading advertising.

In the media, we demand our entertainers dress to impress. In many cases, it would be a bigger scandal to see a politician on stage in casual clothing that to find out your favorite pop idol was lip-syncing. I recently found out that most televised appearances by musicians are pre-recorded to prevent unexpected ''accidents'', so often televison, these musicians are lip-syncing as a matter of course.

Therefore, I think cooperation is much better than competition. When I work with others and cooperate others I feel strong bonds and feel very good to work together. It is possible to accomplish difficult and challenging tasks if we work together as a cooperative group. Harmony is a very powerful thing and can lead to achieving things that are not normally achievable by yourself or by being in competition with others. If there is cooperation and everyone gets along, the process is very smooth and positive. Competition can create a lot of negativity and lead to undesirable outcomes. It can make people not think clearly, whereas cooperation there is great clarity and a great deal of ideas to work with among the group.

While competition may drive people to succeed, I think it also has many negatives. I think cooperation is better than competition because of this. Cooperation allows people to grow and learn and achieve things together in a positive manner. ",3.5,0.998551774
140,COMPETITION,"What is more important when trying to succeed?  Competition or cooperation?

If you ask me then the answer would be cooperation and here is why I think that to
be true.

Some people think that competition is the key to achieving more success in life and
everyday tasks but I think cooperation is definitely more of an important factor in
succeeding.

Cooperation is important because without it you aren't putting in your best effort
and also not learn anything!

Let's say you are on a competitive dance team, your team is learning a new dance
and everyone is being coached on what to do, if you didn't cooperate and listen to
what your coach is trying to teach you then you will not be able to learn the dance
properly and will be off from what everyone else is doing and frankly would most
likely make a fool of yourself.

I personally have a daughter that was on a competitive dance team for four years,
my daughter cooperated and listened to what her coach was saying and doing and
she ended up being front and center in dance competitions and won many times,
while other girls whom did not pay attention or cooperate were not in the front and
looked ridiculous when the whole team danced together, you could definitely spot
which girls were cooperating and which ones weren't.

Some might say that competition is more important than cooperation because
when you are competing and really want to win, you will try harder and do your
best, while this is most likely true, I think that cooperation makes more of a
difference because no matter how hard you try you won't be able to succeed in your
task if you didn't cooperate and don't know what you are doing.

In conclusion, cooperation is far more important than competition when you are
trying to succeed and will bring you much farther in life, next time you are trying to
decide if you should cooperate or just wing it, definitely cooperate because
cooperation is the key to success.","   What is more important when trying to succeed? Competition or cooperation?

In return, whenever our boss is happy we can get promotions, encouragement, and congratulations on our hard work, which in return gives us happiness. Also, within relationships we strive to make sure that our loved ones are happy and we help them achieve their goals.

A person can find many different ways to arouse positive emotions and should be left to determine their preference on their own.",3.5,0.988982162

151,COMPETITION,"Success achieved by competition versus cooperation is, in my opinion, entirely dependent on what type of goal is to be achieved. However, broadly speaking, competition works best in terms of sports and games, whereas cooperation is the superior option when trying to create something or achieve a common goal.

Sports, as an example, is an area where competition thrives because competition is the point. We watch sports to see our team be better than another team, and we reveal in the thrill of victory. But it's implicit in sports that competition will happen. We get into sports expecting competition and we are fully prepared for it. We consent to competing by taking part in spots, and so we are okay with the fact that we are in a competition. This is not to sat that there is also not cooperation in sports - for example, we cooperate by agreeing on a set of rules, or a location where the sport will be played. This fact also ties into my next point - why cooperation is superior to competition for reaching a common goal.

When we are trying to achieve a common goal or create something, though, collaboration is almost always the better option. Humans are naturally different from each other in many ways; we think about things differently from each other and what seems obvious to one person may be difficult to notice for another person, and vice versa. If we are trying to create something new and beneficial, it is better for people to cooperate because by bringing together so many different minds and backgrounds and outlooks to the same goal, we have a better chance of achieving our goal.  If we compete with each other, we do not get the benefit of each other's thoughts and opinions, and we suffer for it. In the paragraph above, I talked about cooperation in the context of sports. Cooperation works even in this context because if people were not able to agree on a set of rules or a location to play the game, for example, there could be no competition because we would not have the sport to begin with.

In this way, cooperation and collaboration is more likely  to produce significant and lasting accomplishments. Competition is fine when we want to create a contest where one person or group comes out on top of the other one, but when everyone needs to benefit form a goal, collaboration is the way to do this. Cooperation is less stressful, more fulfilling, and leads to a better result for everyone - which competition necessarily does not.

153,COMPETITION,"Success is something everyone wishes to achieve. There are different ways success can be achieved. The way each person achieves success depends largely on the personality of the individual involved. Another factor is the motivation.

Success can be achieved by both cooperation and competition. Sometimes, the best way to achieve success sometimes depends on the end goal. For example, a soccer team can achieve success largely by cooperation while in other fields like the marketing sector, success can be achieved through individuals competing to achieve a set target.

Personally, I believe success can be achieved more by cooperation. When everyone works towards same goal, it brings about a pool of individual creatives coming together and doing wonders. The role of diversity in accomplishing success can never be overemphasized. When people come together to achieve a common goal, there are a lot of bright talents and ideas that come together at that point. This does not happen in competitions, instead the ideas work individually and as a result there might not be improvement that would have made the idea wholesome and more functional.

Others might argue that competition brings about more success due to the high need to deliver on an individual level. And as much as I agree with this, I still believe that bringing together the individual skills, talents, and ideas to achieve a common goal, brings about a bigger scale of success.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that success by cooperation is unrivaled and large undefeated.","Success is something everyone wishes to achieve. There are different ways success can be achieved.

155,MATERIALISM,"Do we reaally have too much stuff, does it really make us happy? 

In a nutshell, yes, we do have too much stuff and no, it really doesn't make us happy. Why do we need more than one tv in a home when there is only one person living there? Why are our closests filled to the brim with clothes we probably have not worn or worn once. We fill our home with things we think we need because a commercial tells us we need it in our lives. Materialism rules the world and we will continue to spend on useless unwanted items because we don't want to be the person that doesn't have the latest greatest item.

Since the world is ruled by credit cards, we will always buy, buy, buy. We don't want to be without. We will spend money on things we think we need because this is the American way of life. Consumerism is the great American way to go and its twin is materialism. We will go in debt to make sure we have things that we belive will make out lives better.

Why do so many people believe materialism or having more things is good for society? Some believe it helpa the economy because we spend on more products which puts money back into the economy. However, it may help the economy, but does it help us the consumer? I would say no. it does not. We have more things, but less money, a great credit score, but more debit. Having more possessions, the latest and greatest does not make you happy, it just makes you broke and wanting more.

156,MATERIALISM,"Materialism.  There are so many mixed thoughts on this subject.  Some people are driven in life to acquire more and more material possessions.  Others despise having a lot of items, prefering to live a minimalist lifestyle and live on just the basics.  The question is should modern society be criticized for being materialistic.  We'll look at both sides.

There are some good things about having material possessions.  A lot of people feel accomplished and blessed having lots of possessions.  It gives some people happiness knowing they have a lot of things they can easily access like televisions, cars, clothes, etc.  Those who come from humble beginnings who are later able to acquire these possessions may feel like they have a piece of what they wish they had when they were growing up.  They feel like they are successful knowing they worked for these possessions.

The other side is the downfall of being materialistic.  Unfortunately, there are people out there who are very selfish and will acquire a lot of possessions and purposely keep everything for themselves.  Being materialistic can foster a stingy and selfish mindset.  Some people will step on others to get the possessions.  Also being materialistic can cause people to look down on others who don't have the possessions that they have.

There can be good or bad on both sides.  There are ways to be materialistic and not selfish.  Those who have a lot of possessions can donate to those who don't have much or who don't have anything at all.  It can give a sense of accomplishment and being helpful if you give to others.  Criticizing  won't necesarily help in the area of materialistic people but it would be beneficial to show people that it is okay to have things but not be selfish.  They can be shown that they can be generous while still keeping a lot of possessions.  Those who can easily attain possessions can even show others how to do it as well in a way to help those who don't know how to do it for themselves.  In conclusion, materialism doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing.  It can be used for good if the person wants.","    Materialism. There are so many mixed thoughts on this subject.

158,MATERIALISM,"While materialism has been existent in some manner or another throughout all generations, its definitely more noticable in todays' modern society. We're  all guilty of it to some degree, but it appears the younger generation has taken materialism a bit too far. However, one must ask if these people are to be blamed for their excessive taste for material possessions. After all, they  have obtained their knowledger from previous generations and it is most likely considered a learned behaviour. We all spend significiant amounts of our time consuming one thing or another to a large degree, but the question arises as to whether or not modern day society should be criticized for something that has been going on generations.

In modern day society, far too many people consider the value of money and the things it can but to be greater than ever before. In the past, people were more content with socializing and held greater spritual and cultural beliefs. I think these beliefs are what kept people so grounded. Today, the balance between what is and what is not important in life seems to be off. For instance, some people are more concerned with a scratch on their Apple watch or iPhone case more than someone who is in need of assistance. Before all of these possessions were available, people payed greater attention to other individuals and their needs. Despite all this, modern society is not to be completely blamed for such maerialism. No one individual created this pattern of excessive spending and acquiring possessions. With the development of technology came an increased habit for individuals to desire new and improved products. So, if we are looking for someone to blame, we can't pinpoint the blame on any specific group of individuals.

With all the knowledge and power that people hold in modern society, it is nearly impossible to go backwards and have people not care about materialism. Materilism does have many good aspects associated with it, such as personal happiness and economical benefits. The problem is that people are now more focused on their personal possessions than they are on culture and religion. I think we all need to take a step back and remember what brought us here in the first place.

Or maybe let's not address it all.  Too often a purchase is made without full disclosure and full details of the actual product.  The fabric of that gorgeous dress wasn't as luxurious as the picture appeared.  The yogurt isn't nearly as creamy as the advertisement alluded to.  Disappointment prevails if we believe everything we see and hear.

Of course, no one is going to use an amateur photographer to photograph the items for sale.  Because we want the best opportunity to market our products.  However, if the consumer is fooled, how will those reviews after the sale look?

In conclusion, honesty is always the best policy. Put your information out there and let an opinion be formed.  Let's help people become smart consumers and opinion creators instead of creating a facade that many won't realize until it is too late.",3.5,0.940023068

Wealthy business owners have done more for communities and societies plenty more than people truly realize, such as donating to charities, and get no praise. Fine, who cares. But if they acquire high value possessions, they are judged for being greedy. However, there are those without status or great achievements who boast about their possessions and may deserve to be criticized for it. But if their families achieved great things and spoiled the younger generation, why should anyone outside of that family care?

176,HAPPINESS,"Happiness is something that each person defines differently for themselves. The same would be true for the way to achieve happiness. And the same goes for what importance happiness has in a person's life, is it the ultimate goal without which life is not worth living or does it have a lesser priority or importance?

However, a happy person is more likelyto radicate that happiness out to others, make others happy and let them share in their happy outlook and therefore has a beneficial influence on others and world around them. A happy person rarely lashes out or takes their moods out on others and presumably gets angry less often.

It is rare for people to derive all of their happiness from making others happy, the overwhelming majority of people expect something more or less tangible in return for any efforts that focus on others' wellbeing and happiness. It's undeniable that giving gifts and improving people's lives has a beneficial effect on the gift-giver and improver, but true happiness from these actions will only arise if the person who is the giver also receives at some point. Not necessarily from the same source that has been their beneficiary, but unless we're looking at a true saint, which is rare, most humans require some sort of acknowledgement of their effort to find happiness along this path of action.

In a life situation where the focus on one's happiness is achievable without detracting from others' happiness and without neglecting any familial or other interpersonal or work-related duties it is perfectly acceptable to put great emphasis on self-care, individual happiness and well-being. Only then can a person be fully present when it comes to making others happy. pursuing one's own dreams and goals also doesn't have to be mutually exclusive with caring for others; someone whose dream it is to be a doctor adds to others' haappiness by keeping them healthy, at least that would be the ideal. Someone who dreams of emulating the life of Albert Schweitzer or Mother Theresa would fall into the same category.

I would argue that the path to happiness really varies with the person seeking happiness and their individual idea of it and there is more than one way to achieve it.

Another position would be that happiness isn't actually something that can be chased and achieved, but more a state of mind. In other words - simply be happy first and the rest will fall into place. But I can assert that from my own experience in choosing life paths, that is rarely the case. Happiness needs work sometimes.

Although lifes purpose may look different depending on the indivitual, it ultimately can be measured in a persons overall happiness. Happiness in life is attained by a focus on personal goals and the journey that results from working toward achieving them.

By setting a personal goal,an indivitual is outlining what happiness looks like for this. This might not be a conscious effort,at least not at surface level. For emaple,someone might set agoal to reach a particular level in their carrer. By reaching this level,they believe they will have the oppurtunity to make a larger difference in their field, perhaps interact with and impact more people, and have an increased income. Each of these benefits will offer improved happiness in their life: they will have more money to buy items or experience, and live with the knowledge that they have left a legacy for the future. The journey along the way meeeting those goals provides opportunities for developing happiness in life.

The path that one takes while working toward a goal is just as important at promoting happiness as the goal itself. In the previous example, in order for a person to meet their personal goal of career growth, they must certainly make small steps towards this on a daily basis. Positive interactions with coworkers or clients would not only make progress on career advancement, but also improve happiness on a smaller, more regular scale.

One starts to enjoy having these things because it might make them feel important or make them feel like they have a high social status.  They might enjoy having other people look up to them for all the things they have.

Being materialistic could be a good or bad thing.  People that are materialistc might consume so many things, they start to not have room in their lives for the things that matter.  Friends, family. When you are materialistc, you might not make friends that have the best intentions. It's possible they might want to just be your friend because of all the material stuff you have. A nice car to drive around in, a pool in your backyard, money to go shopping with. Someone might see all these things you have a think they can befriend you and sharer in all these things. Those that have a lot of material things, might have trouble trusting others.

Some people might not think being materialistic is a problem. One might think as long as you don't let those things go to your head. As long as you believe or think we are all equals. That no one is better than anyone else just because they have nice things. If those material things bring you close together as a family, if they create long lasting memories. It's possible that someone could have a lot of money because they have worked hard for it, but not be materialistic. They might donate to charities often. If they lost everything, it wouldn't affect them very much. It really just depends on the person. There might be people out there that have a lot of money but choose not to flaunt it. They might choose to have a 10yr old car to drive, or live in a house that cost only 100k when they could afford something that cost 5 times that much. It really just comes down to the person. Are they trying to become popular or admired for the material things they possess or are they genuine and just don't care how others see them.

If you don't show them off or expect others to see you a certain or better way.

My conclusion is that being materialistic isn't just a good or bad thing. I believe it depends on how you perceive yourself, and how you want others to perceive you as well.

By cooperating by company guidelines or working with others in a team-oriented atmosphere, there is more success since there isn't that pressure to compete and win. I would rather cooperate, do my fob right and well and leave as stressless as possible. Competition seems incredibly stressful and always have to be the best not matter what.

Two common sources of happiness are found in pursuing one's own goals and helping others achieve their goals. Although these are both reasonable methods to find happiness, it is clear that pursuing one's own goals is most likely to be successful.

People are generally focused on their own enjoyment and health. This is reflected in the common saying that we are all the star in our own stories. We learn to define our goals and dreams in early childhood, when our parents encourage us to walk, then talk, to earn good grades and find good friends and be good friends to others. This mentality continues into adulthood as we strive to have goos careers, the best children or the fastest 5K. By setting goals, we give ourselves purpose in life and find personal satisfaction.

Another advantage of focusing on ourselves is that we can change and redefine our dreams as we meet or struggle to reach our milestones. This puts us in charge of our own happiness.

Completing our goals allows us to be comfortable and proud of ourselves and secure in our own abilities. By being comfortable and happy with ourselves we are then able to focus on others.

A worthwhile pursuit is to help others define and achieve  their happiness. There are myriad ways to do this, through volunteerism, financial contributions and political activism. No doubt anyone would be happy to see someone else succeed and to be part of that success would be rewarding. However, by making one's own happiness depend on someone else is risky and relies too much on others  to be as interested and willing to work towards their happiness as you are willing to work for them. In addition, if others are aware of your need for them to success they may feel gulity or ashamed if they are unsuccessful, thereby ruining the happiness of you both.

195,HAPPINESS,"This essay is about happiness and gives my opinions on weather people are more likely to be happy if they focus on themselves and their goals or on the happiness of others.

I think it depends on the person and everybody is different but in general I think most people are happiest with a mix of both. For example a person who graduates college with a good degree in their field of interest. They will be very happy having focused on themselves and having achieved a degree. But they will also be happy having pleased their parents. I know some college students who were only doing it to please their parents, not themselves.

There is an old saying that say's something like most people are about as happy as they have made their minds up to be. Still happiness means many different things to different people. So do some people give to charities for example to help others in need or to feel good about themselves and be happy with themselves? Again I think it depends on the person. My mother in law likes to give because she wants to be recognized as a giving person not because she likes to give. It makes her feel good to be thought of as a giving person.

In conclusion I know that some people may have a solid opinion one way or the other and may disagree with my opinion that a balanced life of focusing on both yourself and others is the best way to happiness. Everybody is different so it is impossible to say what makes everyone happy one way or the other. Think of person that just won the lottery. They are very happy but then look at how many people ended up unhappy in the end having wasted much of it and given much of it away. There is an old song with lyrics something like make someone happy and you with hsppy too. I think there is a lot of truth to that.

Selfishness is defined as thinking only of oneself amd in United States culture, it is generally considered a bad thing. Being a social norm, this causes certain feelings behind those behaviours and being happy is not one of those feelings.

When looking at what makes someone happy, behaving in a negative (selfish) was is not going to lead to ultimate happiness. The only way to happiness is to look outside ones own self and focus on the betterment of the community and other people. It helps us, as humans, look at the larger picture and get outside of our own heads. It gives us worth and helps us to feel as if we belong and matter. Experiencing the love of a family through close friendship, leads to happiness. Happiness comes from experiences, love, and socializing; not instant gratification and inward reflection.

But while he is dying he is explaining that all of those things don't matter because no-one was there to share the experiences with them. It is basically like they never happened. He wasn't happy because he never shared the love.

Striving to improve other's lives - in large ways or small - is intensely gratifying and fulfilling. This is based on my personal experience and that of those around me. By focusing on goals that help family, friends, community or country improve, a person attains a sense of achievement, competence, accomplishment and pride.

But either way, the best evidence that happiness follows service can be found by looking at and studying the lives of those who follow that path. 

Some might argue that focusing on the well-being of others robs people of their own dreams and results in failure to pursue worthy goals.

In these days in time, you can't really operate in too many places in the US where you can get around regularly without having a vehicle.

204,APPEARANCE,"There is no doubt that thr realm of social ,edia has significantly changed the way  we aa a society view one another. The question that this change then begs is whether our new view of others and ourselves has negative consequences. I am going to look at this question through the lens of social interaction as well as product or company engagement, because the two areas do not have the same impacts.

Turning to first to product or company engagement, let's consider the example of thechnology. A company like apple profits heavily  off of aesthetics. They have relesed a number of products in diffrent colors and are able to charge extra for these designs. For example, their latest aplle watch functions in esssentiallly the same way as the previous version. There may be few minior software updates, but the avereage user would likely have the same experience with either version. However, because they are offering more aesthetically pleasing versions of the watch and charging more for these designs , they are profitting primarily off of aesthetic preferences. In fact much of Apple's business mode and consumer base revolves around the look of the products just as much as, if not more than their functionality. It is difficult to say whether this design -centered model is negative , because some people do value aesthetics in their products over what they can do internally.

This potential value of design over substance leads to the socail side of the issue. People are often judged based on their aesthetics, either by the look of the products they won or the look of the individual themselves. Especially where celebrities are concerned, onlookers determine whether they like or dislike someone based on how they look or the products and brands they with which they are affiliated. At the personal level, this could be problematic.

207,MATERIALISM,"Materialism is something that many of us experience in our lives. What is materialism? Materialism is the acquistion of items by spending money. You may have heard the phrase ""keeping up with the Jonases"". That phrase is a perfect example of materialism. But are we too materialistic? Does it really give our lives purpose? That answer will vary depending on who you ask . 

There are benefits and disadvantages to our materialistic lifestyles. Materalism can create more jobs and opportunities for people to make a living. If people did not have a desire to purchase anything other than what is necessary, much less items would be produced in the world, leading to fewer available jobs. Materialism can also bring happiness into people lives by giving them things to look forward to and providing them with something to do on their free time, such as playing video games or watching movies. 

Materialism can also cause a lot of harm. It contributes to more waste from all of the purchases and packaging being thrown away, and causes pollution from the creation of materials. It can also cause people to care too much about items and not enough about the people around them. Many people work more than necessary so that they can purchase things that they don't need. This may bring them happiness, but for how long? 

So, should modern society be criticized for being materialitic? There is no correct answer. Materalism can cause just as much harm as it can produce benefits. I do believe some people would have a difficult time adjusting to a world that was not so focused on materialism, but a reduction could strengthen our bonds with each other as we focus on people and less on items.","Materialism is something that many of us experience in our lives. What is materialism? Materialism is the acquisition of items by spending money. You may have heard the phrase ""keeping up with the Joneses"". That phrase is a perfect example of materialism. But are we too materialistic? Does it really give our lives purpose? That answer will vary depending on who you ask.

There are benefits and disadvantages to our materialistic lifestyles. Materialism can create more jobs and opportunities for people to make a living. If people did not have a desire to purchase anything other than what is necessary, much less items would be produced in the world, leading to fewer available jobs. Materialism can also bring happiness into peoples lives by giving them things to look forward to and providing them with something to do on their free time, such as playing video games or watching movies.

Materialism can also cause a lot of harm. It contributes to more waste from all of the purchases and packaging being thrown away, and causes pollution from the creation of materials. It can also cause people to care too much about items and not enough about the people around them. Many people work more than necessary so that they can purchase things that they don't need. This may bring them happiness, but for how long?

It can be had through personal experiences and from witnessing the happiness for one person could be completely different for another. It can be self-directed or benevolent. It's the ultimate goal to feel complete.
Humans tend to be more focused on their own happiness rather than the happiness of others. It's a feeling we all strive for in our lives to make ourselves feel whole and satisfied. Everyone has dreams and goals in life from the time we're children and they can last until we die whether we've achieved them or not. When dreams and goals are hard to reach, great happiness can be had when they come to fruition. You reflect back on your hard work to get to where you wanted to be and than satisfication brings happiness. But our dreams and goals don't have to be grandiose to bring about happiness.
Some people find happiness when they are able to witness others experiencing happiness. This is something most parents experience when watching their children grow. They take joy in seeing their child's face light up when they receive a gift they were hoping for or achieving a new milestone that they worked hard to arrive at. People can find happiness when they witness progression in society such as underprivileged groups gaining equal rights or people coming together to help someone in need.
When a person achieves a personal dream or goal, it can also lead to experiencing other's happiness. Setting up a charity drive or fundraiser starts out as a personal goal. When that person reaches that goal, they get to experience the joy and gratefulness of the people they aimed to help.
At humanity's core, we always come back to self-directed happiness being the more likely kind of happiness that people wish to achieve. Even when we experience joy in someone else's happiness, there's still some selfishness to the concept because others' happiness affirms our beliefs, wants and desires.

It is a topic of discussion among the scientific community, but more importantly, it is a feeling and notion frequently reflected upon within the general population. Though difficult to describe,it can be described as a feeling of contentment, of satisfaction. But for what exactly? What are we satisfied with? What are we content with? Some may feel satisfied seeing others happy or at least attaining their own goals. Others may feel satisfied when their own  personal goals are attained. This leads to the question of whether one feels more happiness if they focus on their own goals or if they focus on the happiness of others. Indeed, true happiness can only be achieved if one focuses on his or her own personal goals and conquers them.
 
The saying goes that one cannot be loved if they do not love themselves. The same goes for happiness. See others achieve their goals can be truly motivating, inspirational, and it may even instill a feeling is happiness in us - but more than likely,that feeling is fleeting. Once we reach a certain threshold of seeing others succeed and be happy while we either continuously fail or feel incomplete, we will slowly lose that feeling  of happiness, wondering why we are unable to be as accomplished, and eventually fall into sadness, or at least disappointment. Their is a universal desire of feeling fulfilled, and often this goes  misunderstood for nearly a lifetime. What is not misunderstood is the empty feeling it leaves within us. Phychologists support the idea of vicarious living, where one feels emotions through witnessing the lives of others. However, it is important to understand that it is not simply witnessing another's life, but actually imagining we are living that life. So whatever hapiness we feel when someone else attains happiness we feel when someone else attains happiness, it feels as though we are that person and so we have actually attained happiness. This may seem like an argument supporting happiness as a result of another's happiness, but in reality, is a our subconscious needing to fell happiness, and because we are unable to achieve it ourselves, we look for it elsewhere.

Success can be achieved through competitive practices, or more contemplative practices, or through cooperation with others, etc. But I believe it is through cooperation that success is more likely to be achieved, and that the success will be more long-lasting.

Cooperation involves examination, discussion, generation of ideas involving multiple persons with multiple life experiences and multiple perspectives. As no one person ever has the ""only"" idea that will work, the combining of discussion/ideas/solutions of more than one person exponentially increase the likelihood of success and the attainment of the desired outcome.

Examples that come to mind are athletes who engage in individual sports such as swimming and diving. Or the pianist who is intent on perfecting a particularly difficult composition. Or the hunter intent on harvesting enough game to feed his family. In these instances, however, the accomplishments are of a more temporary nature.

On the whole it is the cooperative drive to produce the best possible outcome that I believe accounts for most longlasting successful outcomes. Cooperation may take longer as you have to evaluate and QA things like feasibility and effectiveness and broad applications. And it is usually more slow-going when incorporating different ideas and perspectives.But over the long run, the accomplishments of cooperative endeavors are more stable, more effective, more satisfying and less flawed.","There are many ways to achieve success in this country depending upon the area of endeavor and the definition of ""success"".

What we see and what we hear is not the full story, but people still believe it . It can be extremely easy to see images and have them create impressions that are not the actula reality.
Living in a society in which the lives of celebrities, athletes, and political figures dominate the headlines, we often make strong connections to these figures based on what we hear and what we see. Whenever we hear a positive sotry about a famous figure or read quotes from an interview, it is easy to feel like we personally know that person. But time and time again, we see that the information presented to us isn't the whole truth. Recent news stories about the legal troubles of actor Ezra Miller paint them as a very troubled individual in need of therapy and mental help. Prior to these stories, however, Ezra was always presented as a talented and quirky actor who was passionate about the projects they took on. It was easy to see Ezra dress up in cosplay at Comic Con and think they were a fun, carefree person to be around.
Unfortunately there was no way of knowing the troubles they were experiencing internally. What we see online or on television is just a small portion of their life, and what we are seeing may not be their authentic, true self.

The way famous people and products are presented and marketed are always going to be exaggerated to some extent. It is important that each person does their own research on new products to see if it will really meet their wants and needs. We also need to acknowledge that famous figures are not always their authentic selves when presented in the media. We need to understand that they are human just like us, and that they are going through some of the same struggles that we experience. Society as a whole needs to be more mindful of the images that we are seeing, and be more mindful of the images that we are seeing and hearing may not be reality. ","People often say that it is so important to make a good first impression. Presenting a good image  from the start can leave a good lasting impression with people.  But is this first impression truthful? Can we have a good understanding of something or someone new after such a small sample size?  Sometimes this is possible, but most times we need more evidence.  What we see and what we hear is not the full story, but people still believe it.  It can be extremely easy to see images and have them create impressions that are not the actual reality.

Living in a society in which the lives of celebrities, athletes, and political figures dominate the headlines, we often make strong connections to these figures based on what we hear and what we see.  Whenever we hear a positive story about a famous figure or read quotes from an interview, it is easy to feel like we personally know that person.  But time and time again, we see that the information presented to us isn't the whole truth.  Recent news stories about the legal troubles of actor Ezra Miller paint them as a very troubled individual in need of therapy and mental help.  Prior to these stories, however, Ezra was always presented as a talented and quirky actor who was passionate about the projects they took on.  It was easy to see Ezra dress up in cosplay at Comic Con and think they were a fun, carefree person to be around.  Unfortunately, there was no way of knowing the troubles they were experiencing internally.  What we see online or on television is just a small portion of their life, and what we are seeing may not be their authentic, true self.

218,COMPETITION,"People achieve more success through cooperation than competition. Cooperation has aspects of competition ingrained within it, thereby promoting avoiding failure and achieving important victories. 

Cooperation has many benefits in contributing to success. First, when cooperating with others to achieve a similar goal, the work burden lessens. When people are stressed, they tend to perform worse. By spreading responsibility over a group of people, there are defined roles that piece together to achieve the greater goal. By pouring all effort into one thing, the person can ensure that the thing is perfected.

Second, when cooperating with others, there is a greater share of ideas that one may not have thought of, when competing individually. Throught the sharing of ideas, people tend to get into deep discussions that help weigh out the pros and cons of each idea. An idea that one person has, may not be one that another has. With greater discussion of ideas, there is a higher likelihood to think of something novel, while also building upon existing good ideas.

Third, working cooperatively creates a sense of camaraderie that helps push the focus of the people in your group. People do not want to let each other down. While this could be a good and bad thing, a lot of the times, it is a good thing. The fear of letting others down can prove to ensure that people get their work done. It even allows people to talk to their peers if they are struggling. If someone is struggling, a member of the group is more likely to help out. A group sense of identity  creates more opportunities to help others out.

Overall, when helping ease the pressure, people work harder and better, thereby allowing for greater progress towards the common goal.

While competition and intense rivalry can drive people either to avoid failure or to achieve important victories, cooperation can also do the same. Intense rivalry corners oneself into themselves and puts immense pressure. While doing it alone, there may be no one to turn to, as there are other comeptitors around. When all seems hopeless, the likelihood that one gives up is greater. Success always has some sort of failure. But failing alone feels much worse than failing as a group. Failing alone leaves you no one to turn to, while failing as a group may have more likelihood that everyone wants to make it up to each other and solve the problem.

219,HAPPINESS,"This writing assignment asks the question, ""Are people more likely to be happy if they focus on their personal goals or on the happinesso of others?"" This is a silly question. The answer is obviously and firmly the former. It is natural for people to be happy when they are doing what they want to do, not doing what they think they ought to do or doing what they were told to do. I am happiest ignoring people are not interesting anyway. I make the most progress just minding my own business, doing my own thing, being myself.

People who live for other people are the most miserable people. My mother is like that. When I ask her what does she want to eat, she turns around and asks what do I want to eat,. Liberals are like that too. Liberals think their goal in life is to always think of the political correct thing to say, to never offend anybody. So they waste their time believing they are saving the world but are actually self-destructive. Have you ever met a happy liberal? I haven't. They never laugh at jokes. They walk around with a serious look on their faces all the time, focused on correcting social injustice, even where injustices don't exist. This kind of external existence is unhealthy. It's a kind of mental illness, always pleasing people. They place their personal worth on public approval rather than personal development. These are sad people. Even when liberal policies are shown to hurt the poor and minorities, they persist in their delusion because their self-image depends on it.

So happiness definitely comes from pursuing own goals. We are lucky to live in a country where we have the freedom to pursue our own happiness. Those who want to destroy that freedom have mental issues. They have issues with their personality, with self-confidence, with insecurity. They believe if they do all the things they are told to do, then they can be happy. But that never happens, because they have ignored their true selves. It is a sad thing to see that in whole generations.

220,COMPETITION,"There's a debate over whether people achieve more through competition, or through cooperation. Which do you think it is?  Do you think it's competition? Or cooperation? I'm sure the majority will say that competition is the best way to achieve more and to be more successful. I'm going to go against the flow though. I believe that people can achieve success through both, but they'll be more successful through cooperation. I know that may sound unheard of, but let me explain!

Success through cooperation might be more fun sometimes, but it has its drawbacks. Some people, when competing, may take things too far. Low blows may be dealt which can cause conflict among the people within the competition. This can lead to harsh feelings toward each other. With competition, you also have people who are only trying to push their own ideas as the solution, and are therefore presenting reasons for the opposing ideas to be invalid. Additionally, in competition, each team is thinking of only their own view point. This can lead  plausible solutions to be overlooked. 

Cooperation is better to use if people want to achieve success that results in significant and lasting accomplishments. When people cooperate, they are working as a team in which everyone is looking to reach the same end goal. Also, when cooperation is used, those who are working as a team are putting their heads together to share and discuss ideas that could be beneficial to the end goal. Problems can be prevented when ideas are shared and discussed. When people work together, they can share what they see as successful ideas as well as what they see as potential problems that can arise from certain ideas. What person A. might not be able to see, person B. or C. might be able to see and present to person A. Working together collectively draws more success.

Through cooperation, everyone works together to achieve success and claim victories. Additionally, when using cooperation, people are more content with no hard feelings towards one another because every person is working together to achieve that end goal.

221,MATERIALISM,"Materialism is a word often used in a derisive way to label someone as shallow, concerned only with meterial goods.But is there an argument that would indicate that materialism,at least to some degree, is not such a bad thing? Could it even be a good thing?

I believe that in our society, and economy,materialism shouldn't be considered in such a negative light. In fact, I think it contributes to much f the success of our society, I will ebdeavor to explain why.

If one could largely seperate a person from society and the economy, then the perception of his/her materialistic actions might indeed be negatively viewed. It would perhaps show a disregard for the welfare of others. An interest mostly in materialism might indicate a form of selfishness.

But we don't live completely disentangled from the other memberss in our society. What we do can and does affect them, if even only a little. And every person in this complex modern society has to have a way to make a living, earn enough to provide them and their families with food, shelter, clothing, and even som entertainment (good for the soul).

How can each of us have jobs to do that, jobs where we make things like furniture, cars, electronic devices, household goods, clothes, etc.? For us to have such jobs, someone has to buy those goods, those ""materials."" That is, at least some materialism in our society is what drives our economy, a necessary part of our society. So the buying og goods and enjoying them drives the economy, provides jobs for others, and spreads the wealth.

One could argue that materialism still suggests selfishness, dedication only to material and not fellow citizens. But is that really true? Does not a parent need to obtain meterial to feed hos family, provide shelter for his family? Aren't all of these items to take care of one's family all material goods?

I agree that a person could be one who's material purchases all go for himself or herself, and that would be an extreme of materialism that would perhaps poorly on his or her social charecter. But a large degree of materialism not totally targeted to one's self is surely a good thing for the economy, stretching thus to other families, and so on.

So I conclude that even extreme materilalism, purchasing only for one's self, might certainlt be bad for a person's family if thet have one, but even at that, it would help drive the economy and in son help others have jobs and care for their families. Thus at the core, some level of materialism is a necessary ingredient for supporting our economy, which in turn suppors our entire society.","Materialism is a word often used in a derisive way to label someone as shallow, concerned only with material goods.

I think it's only true that materialism is more in our faces todat because of social media, but I don'e think it's unique to modern history. Finding ways to flex and show off our wealthy has been common throughout history. people used to show off how rich they were based on what kind of clothes they wore (for instance, silk and deep rich dyes were used to indicate wealth and status) the food they ate and that hasn't changed at all.

It is my personal opinion that happiness can only be achieved  when  you yourself are happy first.Personal happiness may include achieving small personal goals over a short period of time or working toward those goals over  a short period of time or working toward those goals over a long period of time.Someone can be happy by completing a simply daily ""to-do"" list or possibly by simply checking some items off of that list. The level of happiness can only be measured by the person completing the process, therefore you measure your own happiness.
It is also perceived that happiness can be achieved through making  others happy.Seeing others happy,maks you happy.As each individual determines whether or not they are happy,I would think that this approach to happinesswould be like chasing a leaf in the wind or short-lived at best.Because you are depending on others level of happiness for you would be happy the majority of the time. Each  individual person determines what happiness is to them, which may be very different than what happiness is to you.

Basically, you can make yourself happy or depend on the happiness of others to determine your happiness.

It is my personal opinion that happiness can only be achieved when you yourself are happy first. Personal happiness may include achieving small personal goals over a short period of time or working toward those goals over a long period of time. Someone can be happy by completing a simple daily ""to-do"" list or possibly by simply checking some items off of that list.  The level of happiness can only be measured by the person completing the process, therefore you measure your own happiness.

It is also perceived that happiness can be achieved through making others happy.  Seeing others happy, makes you happy.  As each individual determines whether or not they are happy, I would think that this approach to happiness would be like chasing a leaf in the wind or short-lived at best. Because you are depending on others level of happiness for you to be happy, there is no guarantee that you would be happy the majority of the time.  Each individual person determines what happiness is to them, which may be very different than what happiness is to you.

Last year, I needed to buy a car. I saved my money, and waited until the right opportunity came. I purchased a used car from a friend, for 3,000.00.

If everyone made decisions with their purchases based on their needs instead of the worlds flashy expectations, not only would it benefit our pockets but would also benefit the environment.

There is nothing wrong with spending money. It is something that everyone has to do. I do think that modern society focuses too much of thier time and money on things that do not matter. Do people really need to have 50 pairs of fancy shoes that they neverwear? Do people need to have giant mansions? No, people do not need these things.

Acrors and actresses get roles because they look good, not because they can act, people get arrested because they ""look"" like a criminal, even if there's no evidence supporting it, people get bashed just for looking unattractive. Images have way too much power over people, and frankly, that'll never change.

Politicians, a lot of them barley know what they're saying, but if they look good while doing it, and speak with confidence, people will eat up every word. Just look at Donald Trump and how he got his way into presidency. He spoke with confidence, he kbew how to grab people's attention, it helped that he was an entertainer, cause that's exactly what he was, entertaining. People would vote for Donald Trumph because of how well he could speak and sway people.

235,COMPETITION,"I personally believe that the power of cooperation is much more useful when it comes to achiveng success, no matter useful when it is that you're trying to achieve. In this essay I'm going to explain to you my reasoning behind this theory and what personal experiences I've gone through that have shaped my opinion on this matter.

i grew up around a brother who was one of the most competitive people that I've ever met. He displayed a ton of qualities that showed me how arrogant people who are competing against each other can be. When people are constantly striving to be better than other people it only leads to an inflated ego and an even more pronounced sense of separation from other people. However, when you work cooperatively as a team towards a similar goal, you can achieve so much more than you ever could have alone.

This is why the power of cooperation is a lot more productive and useful in society today. If we could all work towards a sense of unity consciousness, where none of us are separate, no one is better than anyone else, and we all had good intentions for each other, we could go so much higher than anyone would ever be able to go on their own. That is the whole point of being on this planet, is to learn how to work together to build, to create, to grow...and eventually achieve the sense of oneness that we have all been working towards for centuries.

When we divide. and try to conquer others, we are working against each other and destroying any progress that we've made towards world peace. If everyone was treated equally and fairly, and the illusion of separation was no longer there, we would be living in a much better and more productive world.

People in society today are always to quick tu jump onto the latest trend, or be on par with what is ""woke"", that they forget to take a step back and ask if they really need what they're purchasing. Flashy things are always fun at first, but are usually only flashy for a shot time. I think it is better to stick with tried and true items, that we know can withstand time.

Another thing of note with all the big, bright, flashy new items coming out, is that there is always some refrennce of nostalgia. Products are being replicated (with astoundingly low quality) that reflect past generations. Everybody wants something vintage, but nobody wants to put in the time it takes to make these items with such craftsmanship. 

I think a lot of the television programs and social media apps with rapidly changing content are a bbig reason for this. TV shows change scenes every three minutes, and TikToks last sixty seconds.

On the subject of which achieves more, I would lean towards cooperation achieving more success that competition from my personal experience.
Virtually every environment generally has far more elements of cooperation than competition. cooperation is default and necessary in work,school,home and elsewhere. Not a single company with more than one employee an function without cooperation. Schools are also inherently cooperative since you have to learn materials from teachers in a class full of other students doing the same. At home, it is often necessary to cooperate with family to do laundry, clean the house, prepare food and what not.
There are also many instances where competition would not help you in any way within a classroom or in a job environment. Being competitive instead of cooperative during a work project could be very detrimental to the work project itself. This could lead to sabotage, harm productivity, damage group synergy and ultimately create a very toxic work environment. Each individual tend to have different ideas and information they could bring to the table if they were to cooperate instead of compete. All these examples definitely apply to life at home as well. A toxic atmosphere where too much competiton exist between two family members could lead to an intensely hostile environment where the two fight all the time.

Where is it found and how iss it obtained? These are ago old questions to be sure. Personal happiness can most easily be found in caring for the happiness of those around us. While this may seem counterintutive upon first glance, it stands to reason that when we devote out time time and effort into others then we may also reap those rewards ourselves.

An example of finding happiness by focusin on others is parenthood. While parenting children is no easy task, most parents would say that their children also bring them immense joy. Oftentimes parenting pushes one out of comfort zone- meeting new people, organizing play dates, and attending children's events like library storytime. These tasks appear to be solely beneficial for the child, however the parents can also benifit. For example, when organizing play dates the parent may also get to know another adult and start a friendship they might otherwise not have had. In addition, going on excursions outside of the house is greatly benificial for one's mental health and general sanity.

On the other hand, there are those who would argue that a child-free lifestyle brings more happiness because it allows for full independence. An adult without children will surely have more free time and money to spend on fun activities such as traveling and eating at restaurants. However, family life is so important for many people that they will put those activities to the side while the child grows up. Proponents of happiness derived from serving others would argue that fun activities have their place in moderation, but overindulgence can actually bring about feelings of sadness and emptiness once the fun stops.

The most significant of the wmotions is also the most confusing - happiness. Sometimes it feels as though it is going to burst out your chest, and other times you're sure you'll never feel it again. The path to happiness has been described by many people in many ways. Two of the most prevelent notions are that happiness is found in obtainingyour personal goals and that personal happiness comes from filling others with happiness. But which is right? I will demonstrate that the only path to happiness comes from your achievingyour goals with three simple truths; happiness is a reward for the effort it takes to reach a goal, you cannot be happy if the tools for happpiness are not in your hands, and you cannot know what will make others happy or what happiness will lead them to do.

Nobody works their life away because they want a static life without garnering more respect and reward corresponding to their contributions. And happiness plays a huge part in the drive to move upward and onward. Deciding you want something usually is followed by a lot of difficulty and exertion, but after you've overcome all changes and reached your goal the happiness is overwhelming. And the fact that you earned your happiness only makes it stronger.

Happiness is always in one owns hands regardless of circumstanaces. If  you expect happiness t odrop into your lap, you'ii be sitting around unhappy for the rest of your life. If you want happiness, you have to be in control - nobody else can truly know what you want in life andwhat brings you the most joy. Don't leave yopur happiness in the hands of others - take it as a personal responsibility and let yourself the whole time.

The idea that making other happy will in turn bring you happiness. While this may be true in some cases, this philosopy has a glaring problem - the other people. Some people will never be happy no matter what you do for them. You may be able to make others happy. So what? You have no idea how the people you delivery happiness to weill respond. Many people do thoughtful things for loved ones only to receive lukewarm responses. You can't be happy depending on someone else to make it so.","A huge aspect of human life is our ability to feel emotions - sadness, excitement, upset, anger, love - and the power they sway over our decisions and life choices. The most significant of the emotions is also the most confusing - happiness. Sometimes it feels as though it is going to burst out of your chest, and other times you're sure you'll never feel it again. The path to happiness has been described by many people in many ways. Two of the most prevalent notions are that happiness is found in obtaining your personal goals and that personal happiness comes from filling others with happiness. But which is right? I will demonstrate that the only path to happiness comes from your achieving your goals with three simple truths; happiness is a reward for the effort it takes to reach a goal, you cannot be happy if the tools for happiness are not in your hands, and you cannot know what will make others happy or what happiness will lead them to do.

You see a before and after picture of the entertainer but technology can disguise images to make a person look smaller or bigger.

247,MATERIALISM,"I believe that modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. Everyone in the world wants to be able to own nice things and live a fulfilling life of luxury. This is not a bad thing, however humans need to be concious of how their material pursuits are affecting their environment and other humans.

Acquiring new things that bring happiness into a persons life should not be seen as wrong, in fact it is something worth celebrating. Everyone should have the right to pursue such material goals and enjoy the material wealth that they currently own. However, a lot of people currently are not given the opportunity to realistically pursue their material desires. This is something that we should look to fix, so that as many people as possible can acquire their material desires.

Many people criticize materialism because they see extremely wealthy billionaires flaunt their material gains, while most aren't able to acquire even a fraction of that material wealth throughout their lifetime. If people are given more access to realistically acquire their material desires I believe that resentment towards materialism will begin to dissapear and be replaced with a desire for more materialism. Everyone wants to be able to fulfill their material desires, and the lack of opportunities for the majority of people is the real problem, not materialism itself.

249,HAPPINESS,"I almost ruined my marraige by pursuing my own 
happiness. Not in the way many people ruin thier 
marriages - looking for pleasure outside of their spouse. 
No, for me it was much simpler than that. On May 21, 
2010,I looked my beautifull bride in the eyes and made 
vows to her. I told her ""I do."" The truth is, I had no clue 
what I was doing. I had no clue what love is.

People will be much happier if they are able to set their
minds on the happiness of  others rather than on their
own happiness. The reason is simple - when you are 
focused on being happy you will often find yourself 
disappointed. Rather than discussing the ""big
moments- the every -day thoughts that people deal
with. That is where the true battle for happiness lies.
You see. most moments of life do not consist of feeling
euphoric ( or even pleasent for that matter). What is in a
rainy day to make one happy? A flat tire? Sinus
pressure? A whiny child? Nothing. When one focuses on
being happy, in having conditions favorable to their
liking, they will often find that they are not happy. On
the other hand, if one is focussed on the  happiness of
others then one can overlook the inconveniences of life.
They will come, but niether their presence nor absence
determines weather or not you are achieving  your goal.

This principle is similer  to ideas found within
Buddhism, which claims that suffering is caused by 
unfulfilled  desires. How does on end this suffering?
The answer is to end your desires. if you are not
desiring comfort, then it will not matter whether you are 
uncomfortable. if you are  desiring a romantic
relationship, then it will not a matter whether you are
single. On the other hand, if you are focused on your 
singleness (and are not having good luck finding
someone), ten you will only continue to grow in
unhappiness. So one key to happiness is not so much
that you are focused on others, but it is that you are not 
focused on yourself.

Now to my marriage. I thought that I loved my bride,
but the truth is, I was mostly in love with myself. I was
not focused on how much I could fulfill her- I was
focused on how much she could fulfilled me. I made her a
source of my own happiness and empotional fulfillment.
And Iwas often disappointed. This isn't because she did
something wrong - it is because she could not live up to
all of my expetations and desires all the time. No one
can do that for other person. Unfortunately, it took
me years to come to an awakwing and I spent a lot of 
time brooding in insecurity and bitterness at the women
I thought I loved. She was not the problem - I was.
Why? BecauseI was focused on finding my own 
fulfillment. Thankfully, I had a moment of spiritual 
clarity and realized how twisted and toxic I was
becoming, I was expecting my wife to fulfill me, but
came to realize that marriage is not to made of two
unfulfilled people who nedd each other. It is made of
two fulfilled people coming togeather. Once I removed 
self-fulfillment  from the throne of my mind, my
marriage got much better. No longer was i looking for 
things my wife was doing wrong - I was simply enjoying
the moments. No longer was I doing ""nice things""
for her to affirm me, I was doing them simply for her.
No longer did I wallow in self-pity at any perceived
slight, but i was at peace in my mind. I finally learned
what love is. While it is an immensely complex thing to
define, I will put it this way: love is carring for someone
else with no strings attached.

Sure, someone could make an argument that self-
seeking or pleasure or even achieving one's goals leads
to happiness. But what if those goals or plans do not
work out?  Then will be left feeling unhappy and 
unfulfilled; however, if you are not focused on your own
happiness, then ironically, you will can yourself happy
most of the time.

Sure, it feels great too use your sttrenghts to defeat an opponent or succeed at atask. But what if your opponenet is better than you, or yu have limited task experience? This is when cooperation and teamwork will drive you to even greater successes Working with a variety of talented and smart people, you can  learn from their knowledge and experience and also contribute your own strenghts. These different persepectives will make your team more creative, stronger, and ulttimately more successful.

What is the true source of happonesss? That's a question better left to philosophers but I belive that lasting happiness comes from providing happiness to others.

There are many ways to think about what makes a person happy. Some derive happiness from accomplishments. Some think that it's not the end result but effort taken to reach that accomplishment is the true source of joy. I think those methods might be fleeting. My view is that if the people around you are happy and you can take at least some small amount of credit for that, that's the happiness that will encompass your whole life.

Think about it this way. When you accomplish a goal, you feel exhilarated. But with time that exhilaration lennens and you have to find a new goal to complete to experience that exhilaration again. I'm not saying thhat isn't worthwhile but its temporal in nature. You only get that true feeling of happiness a few times per year. On the other hand, small acts of kindness even to people you don't know can give you a warm feeling of joy many times in a single day. It's difficult not to feel happy when somone smiles at you because you've been helpful to them or even just showed the somee courtesy aand consideration.

The question becomes which is better? I maintain those small daily moments of happiness outweigh those singular moments of exhilaration. These daily moments aren't huge and life changing but they are much more easily attained. For example, helping someone out at the store who is short on their bill. Stopping to help someone change a tire. The exact act isn't really improtant.. Even something as simple as giving someone directions can be a source of satisfaction. I guess that waht I'm trying to say is that happiness is something that really can't be measured in degrees, So is it better to experience small amounts of happiness every day through lump all that together and experience it all at once through one event? I'll take the small satisfactions that leave me feeling happy every day.

This is the thing American dreams are made of, and this is the subject that this essay will be addressing.

Materialism, materialism, materialism. Many people say it is a bad thing, but there are many other people who see no problem with it. What is wrong with wanting more for your family and future posterity the supporters say. This is what America was build upon... or was it?

 It is as wrong as putting the wrong shoe on the wrong foot the rivals proclaim. There is nothing worse than being so selfish as to put yourself in front of others, and putting your needs and desires in the fore. people should desire eternal things such as relationships, love, the supernatural. God should be placed in front of all other things, for life after death means much more than anything that we will leave behind on earth.

What is the point of obtaining all teh things of the world, when one cannot even take to  the other side of death? If the afterlife is real should'nt we spend more time trying to figure out how to get there instead of setting our whole life towards obtaining more and more meaningless things? We should find meaning in life by doing for others, giving to others, and serving others.

People should seek out the Lord through His inspired Holy Word. People should be concerned with bringing people to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ instead of working vainly for money and materials than in the end will rust and come to waste. We should not be wasting every second of every day trying to better ourselves, when there are so many people who need Christ.

Will anyone remember our strivings to obtain everything in the world? Or will they rather remember our goals in helping others, and discovering cures, and ways to better our fellow man's life on this earth? We should read history to determine who is remembered, and who is not....and for what reasons they are remembered or not.

It is easy to criticize people for being materialistic, but are we all not working to feed, clothe, and better our lives? It is even easier to support people who are materialistic for the same exact reason, but have we ever considered the many people who are starving, naked, homeless, who have nothing, and are in need of much? Maybe we should give our things away so that others can live just as well as we can, and use our materials and energy helping people who have needs not just wants.

In conclusions and reflection of the many things and arguments that have been made in this short time, there seems to be a balance that could be struck between the two opposing materialism arguments. Maybe we could spend everyday being materialistic not just so that we have things to eat and wear, but so that others may also have as much as we do. We should have a good living situation, with everything we need and want, but we should also share are materials with those who have none.

It is fine to want to live well, but it should not be our all consuming goal in life. There is much more to life than things and money. Relationships, love, God, and loving our neighbor as we would love ourselves should come at the top of our priorities. Selfishness is not acceptable when someone has enough to give away. I seem to remember a lady in the Bible that gave away the two pennies she had to the Temple, knowing that she may not eat that night.

That is love and devotion. Similarly, Jesus did not put materials and things above us. If He would have, we would not have the opportunity to be saved. He never had to leave Heaven, and everything He had to save selfish people that do not deserve it. He could have been materialistic, but He chose us above all.

There is always a right in the wrong, and materialism in and of itself is not wrong, but making that the god of life is what is wrong. Just some things to think about, and make a decision based upon these thoughts. Some people go to either extreme, but there can be a way to meet in the middle but compromising.

259,HAPPINESS,"Have you ever heard the saying you can't love anyone else until you learn to love yourself? The same goes for happiness. That is, your own happiness can't be found through others- you must find the means ands inspiration inside of your own self in order to experience self growth and, in doing so, to create happiness for yourself.
In order to experience happiness, one must focus on what makes on happy. If you go about life only focusing on what others want you to do, you will not find true happiness. In fact, people-pleasing is actually a toxic trait that can be detrimental to your mental health and undermine your own happiness. If you continually do only for others in order to make them happy while ignoring your own wants and needs, you will not be happy. Rather, you will have only focused on the happiness of others while disregarding your own. You must focus on your own uniqur, individual, self-curated goals and how you plan to accomplish them in order to forge a pathe to true happiness.
Some people will argue that true happiness comes from selflessness, but this is not tru. In order to find happiness within yourself, you must acknowledge yourself, your dreams, your desiresm and your goals. It's important to set and work towards goals for yourself. It is important to assert your boundaries and set limits with others so that you can afford yourself the opportunity to realize your own dreams. If you are not focused of fulfilling yourseld, you will not find happiness within yourself.
Happiness is a feeling that comes from working on yourself, spurred from within yourself. You must look within and ask what is needed for you to be happu. What are your goals? Your dreams? Your desires? Further, how can you get there? Make a plan, and then get to working on it. Accomplishing your personal goals leads to happiness. You must acknowledge these conditions and then work to obtain them, focusing on yourelf- not the wants and needs of others. Only once you have identified and fulfilled your own wants and needs- your own dream and desires- will you be able to obtain true happiness.","Have you ever heard the saying you can't love anyone else until you learn to love yourself? The same goes for happiness. That is, your own happiness can't be found through others- you must find the means and inspiration inside of your own self in order to experience self growth and, in doing so, to create happiness for yourself. 

In order to experience happiness, one must focus on what makes one happy. If you go about life only focusing on what others want you to do, you will not find true happiness. In fact, people-pleasing is actually a toxic trait that can be detrimental to your mental health and undermine your own happiness. If you continually do only for others in order to make them happy while ignoring your own wants and needs, you will not be happy. Rather, you will have only focused on the happiness of others while disregarding your own. You must focus on your own unique, individual, self-curated goals and how you plan to accomplish them in order to forge a path to true happiness.

Some people will argue that true happiness comes from selflessness, but this is not true. In order to find happiness within yourself, you must adknowledge yourself, your dreams, your desires, and your goals. It's important to set and work towards goals for yourself so that you may be able to achieve happiness for yourself. It is important to assert your boundaries and set limits with others so that you can afford yourself the opportunity to realize your own dreams. If you are not focused of fulfilling yourself, you will not find happiness within yourself.

260,MATERIALISM,"The simple things in life are what matter. This is something that i have heard and that at my core I believe. People are too often caught up in buying the latest and greatest model of many products, from clothes, to phones, to toys. Society needs to take a step back and analyze how much emphasis they put on materialism.

I believe people could devote that time and energy spent on purchasing material things into something more useful or more satisfying. If you have the extra money, instead of buying another new shirt, why not donate to a charity. There is probably someone else out there that needs that new shirt more than you do. Instead of buying your son a new video game, take him out to the park and play a game with him. When he's older he won't remember that video game, but he will remember the time he spent with his parents, the time that they decided to him.

Once we have too much of something, we seem to take it for granted, and we do not value it as much. Less is more. How can you decide which one is your favourie stuffed animal when you have twenty of them on your bed? We need to think about the things that are truly important in life. The problem is that many times we want more of something just to have more, it doesn't even give you any more pleasure, or it only makes you happy for a littel while.

One might say that purchasing what we want is our reward for working hard. We deserve to enjoy life, deserve to have the best and the most. Sure there is nothing wrong with purchasing something for yourself, but like I said, less is more. Will it really make you happier and help you sleep better?

Society should be criticized for being too materialistic. We need to wake up and realize that we are focusing on the wrong things in life. When you leave this life, you won't be able to take any of the possessions you acquired anyway, they are yours momentarily anyways.","   The simple things in life are what matter.

261,APPEARANCE,"how do we know that what we're seeing is actually what's there?  This is becoming more of a problem in recent times.

All too often, what we see is not geniune.  Maybe it's a fast food advertisement in which a cheesegburger is robust and filled with toppings, but when you buy the burger in real life it's a small, floppy sandwich.  Or it's a photo on Instagram in wich a celebrity has chiseled features, perfect skin, and smooth hair - but only because they used a filter or Photoshop to improve their looks.

It is important to be cirtitical in one's thinking; to question what we see.  There's that old saying, ""Believe half of what you see and none of what you hear"" - and that applies today more than ever.

Bots can be used to control narratives and influence outcomes.  For Example, a casual observer might think that a large majority of Americans believe that Johnny Depp Should win his defamation case against Amber Heard. Comments on Social media paint Depp as an innocent victon, and Heard as a mentally ill abuser.  Everywhere you look, there are videos and blogs supporting him and tearng her down. But when you look a little closer, you find that many of those ""supporters"" are bots that were deployed by Depp's legal team to influence the public narrative.  Exert a little effort and you'lll easily find that many people support Ms. Heard.

Another example is prevalent in online clothes shopping.   Ads appear on Facebook and Instagram offering beautiful, high- quality clothing for a fraction of the typical price.  But this is because the clothes are knock-offs, made from cheaper materials, with stolen designs.   The ad will show a photo of the ""real"" clothing item, but that's not what they're selling.   It's vital to do research to ensure that what you're seeing is what you will actuall get.   

If we are to be a fair, productive, and intelligent society, we must be skeptical of what we see.   I'm not aruging that we should question every mundane aspect of life.  Not everything is a conspiracy, and I don't believe that there are secret societies running the world or shadow organizations doing nefarious deed.

262,HAPPINESS,"The pursuit of happiness is a matter which has long plagued mankind. Much thought has been dedicated to the subject and many thinkers and experts have put forward considered thoughts on the matter. can happiness come down to fixing oneself on one's own personal goals only, or will happiness find the person who attends to the happiness of others?

Some think that it is right to dedicate oneself to one's own happiness in everyday life and not to concern oneself with the happiness of others. Others take the approach that its far better to focus on the happiness of other people, or humanity. which approach is the better road?

Its difficult to argue that one should not attend to one's own personal happiness. It can be said that by this pursuit one is taking responsibility for one's happiness. There seems to be much weight that can be given to this line of thought and it is a popular one is the united states, perhaps even the norm. Many view the struggles of life to be all-consuming and perceive that helping others is not worthwhile and a waste of valuable time, energy, and effort.

On the other hand there seems to be a real phenomenon that happens when one time and effort to support the happiness of others. One's burdens are shared and even lessened. Social bonds are reinforced. people can find joint happiness, and purpose, in efforts to improve the situations of humans. 

One could make a case for others to forgo their daily personal grind in the chase for happiness for themselves only, but this does not seem realistic. Nor does a life devoted entirely in complete service to others. As in many things a nice balance of these two approaches will I think, manuver a person into the vicinity of happiness. 

The next time the subject of personal comes up, one really deserves to pause and think. How and whwn do I experience happiness? Should i chase after it in the hope that I can find it somewhere? There is no guarantee. What if I help others to the detriment of myself? NO real joy here either. It could very well be that the most sound way to seek after happiness is to do a little happy dance and hope it all balances out in the end.

263,HAPPINESS,"Happiness can vary greatly between people. Some people
are happy being on their own and taking care of 
themselves. Others are their happiest when they are
helping others to achieve their goals or prosper. I would
support that people are more happy when they are
helping others and focusing on their happiness. We
enjoy being around others that are happy and they lift
our moods up

There are few betrer feelings in the world than helping
out others.The look on someones face when you are
able to assist them is princeless.You might not to happy
while you are focusing on athers but the end result is
great. Most of the time when you achieve in helping
someone else improve their happiness you will get that
same feeling inside. I personally like to help friends and
neighbors with work that they are unable to do
themselves. Improving thier house or yard and saving
them money and seeing the end results wikll always put a 
smile on my face. We are naturally caring people so it
only makes sense we want to focus on others. Donating
to charity almost make me happy. I don't expect anything
in return but knowing that my money will go to someone
else or an organization to help others is a good feeling. It
is a sacrifice I am willing to make to help others. That 
sacrifice makes me happy.

We also like to be able to share our happiness with
others. This is best achieved when in a group and
focusing on a group happiness. this is why team sports are
so popular. When the whole team succeeds then 
everyone is happy and that happiness becomes
infectious. 

An Arguement for focusingon yourself and your personal
goals is that you will be happier the more you succeed. If
you land a job promotion or a raise then your personal
happiness wil increase. just don,t think it will increase
as much beacuse you don't have any one to share it with
you can have increased prestige or money but if you
don't have happy people to be with then it will just be an
empty feeling. Focusing on yourself too much also gives
of a selfish vibe. Nobody wants to be around selfish
people. You want to know you can rely on someone else.

Preferences for being happy differ greatly between
people. For the majority of people this world helping
outs succed is the ultimate way to be happy. assisting a
friend or family with a project, donatingto a charity and
expecting nothing in return, or just helping an old lady
with groceries will really put a smile on your face. If we all
strated helping others more instead of being so selfish
then i think the World would be a better and happier
place.

So should we shame people for becoming materialistic? Do we gain happiness from the things we buy? Or do we gain happiness for criticizingf the things other people buy?
I say stop criticizing people, since we as people can only work in the confines of what the people in power give us. We are free to set up our own morals and values, which is great, but often times we use this as a way to make judgements over people as a way of feelings better. I say let people be happy in whatever way they find it. We are all working towards a goal of some sort of success and comport.
When we negatively judge the people the around us for something like materialism, we unknowingly alienate the same people who might actually care about us. If your aunt likes brand-name beauty products, does that make her any less of good mother to your cousins? Wanting to buy nice things is something most people enjoy. I find it strangs to shun people for having goals, standards and things they want to do. Everything in the society we have made costs money.
I can see the other side of the argument,however. As with everything else in the world, things can be taken to an excessive degree. That same aunt, perhaps she would rather buy herself brand-name makeup than save up for her daughter's college founds. There are people who ask for donations online constantly without much of a reason to give, then the next day they share pictures of a freshly done tattoo. I can see this as being a problem, and I honestly would make judgements mysely. But at the end of the day, peoplr are free to do with their money as they see fit.
Materialism, with excess, can be something to criticize. However, the people behind the money often have their own reasons for buying the things they do. Whether it be for repairing mental health or simply wanting to dote on a singinificant other. I don't think anyone is exempt from criticism, but I do think we need to reel it back and think first before accusing and breathing the people around us.

What happens when you are home alone, you are out by yourself, or just alone in general? If the person has focused on the happiness of those around them, is there anything really making them happy in these type of moments? I believe that this is strong supporting evidence that it is best to focus on your personal goals than worry about the happiness of those around you. That doesn't go to say as well that you should totally disregard the emotions of people around you though, you should always be a kind and caring person.

One's self happiness should be one of everyones top priority in life, and as long as something non harmful makes you happy, you should always pursuit it. You may set a personal goal of beating that best time on a video game speed run, you may have the goal of losing weight, maybe you  want to go on walks more and enjoy nature. Using one of these as an example, let's think we have a person who we live with that is extremely needy that doesn't enjoy going out on a walk and you do. If you focused on their happiness only and stayed inside, you would give up something that you wanted to do and a goal that makes you happy. If this example was to be the case and the person in my example would be a partner, it would be best to talk to them about it and come to a compromise at the very least. maybe they could go on walks with you, maybe you could even get a dog and go on walks with all three of you. Adding steps towards achieving a goal is something everyone has to do from time to time.

Life isn't always sunshine and rainbows however, let's use an elderly parent as an example, or someone you need to care for. In times like this, you may need to temporiarly delay a personal goal to help them, but you can always reasume it later. The key to this is to make sure that once you do what needs to be done, you are picking up your personal goal where you left off. Too many people give up on it in a situation like this and end up becoming depressed later down the road. Another option in this is let's say someone you need to care for is wheelchair bound, maybe you could combine your personal goal with them as a compromise. This would allow you to keep an eye on them and care for them while doing what you love. This could even allow both ofyou to bond with one another, creating even more happiness in your life. you could even use a personal goal you want to achieve, depending on what type of goal it is, as a surprise trip for said person. Be creative if your goal allows it, and always try to stay positive regardless of the situation.

If your own peronal goal is to make others happy then that's different from your happiness coming from those around you. Many comedians fall outside of this category sadly, while on stage they are making others laugh but off stage they are depressed. A good example of this goal would be offering to help the homeless or even go to a nursing home to talk to the residents that are living there. Another personal goal that could make someone happy is hust being more light not only in their own life, but in the lives of other's as well. This is where I feel the sweet spot in life is for this topic, it shows that you are not self centered and care about those around you, but at the same time you are doing something  that makes you happy.

Staying dedicated to your own personal goals is important in life, even when times are hard, you need to keep going. Too many people in today's world look back at their life and wish they would have done something differently, maybe they left things unsaid, or maybe they settled for something or someone. People do this for different reasons, but primarily because they are putting other peoples happiness before their own happiness. You are your own person, don't allow someone to influence or manipulate you into caring about their happiness while disregarding yours.

Competition is a natural response to someone doing
better than you. You end up wanting to strive harder and
do better. You may end up studying harder for a test,
working harder on a project, and improving your skills.

Others believe that cooperation helps achieve
accomplishments better than competition. While that can
be true in some cases, when it comes down to doing
better, competition will alwaysmake people try harder.
Without competition, people may not want to do better
and can become stagnant. We as humans want to be
successful and have material posessions, and most of
those who achieve that do so with competition.
Competition made me personally try to do more for
mysefl, and I became a better athlete, student, and
employee because of it. I wanted to make myself better
myself, because I felt the drive to do so from competition.
I felt happier with myself, that I was able to do what I
sought to do from it. I remember from a young age feeling
that competitive drive, and I worked harder to get better
grades and be a better athlete. I felt incredibly
accomplished when I attained that. I had more self esteem
because of it, and I feel people in general have better self
esteem because of competition.

At the end of the day, you wil see stronger and better
result through competition. You will see harder working
people because of it. You will end up feelings better about
yourself when you achieve your goals, because you know
how hard you worked to get to them. You also will try to
resolve issues yourself more, because being competitive
forces you to come up with ideas on how to solve a

268,APPEARANCE,"Images and impressions make more of an impact on people than they should. Many factors contribute to people favoring style over substance.
In some cases, people don't have much ability to judge something on its actual content rather than flashy images or video. This is because the content is not shown until after a purchase is made. One example is a  video game commerical that only shows cutscenes from the video game. These are usually the parts of the game with the best graphics and perhaps the most emotional content. However, the bulk ok the game may be something else entirely. Maybe the game player will see 3D models with less detail than in the cutscenes during most of the game. Maybe the game will mostly be a game board with small representations of characters compared to what is seen in the cutscenes. Some people have probably been tricked into buying a video game thinking it has incredible graphics when most of the game is actually not that good.
people may also chose to listen more to people who look good rather than choosing them bases on their messages. If you believe that all the things people say are boring, wouldn't you like to hear those words from someone with a pretty face? Some people may also think that a person who minds his or her looks also has better things to say. Unfortunately, a makeup artist may be the only difference between an attractive face and an unattractive face. In that case, a person's appearance has little to do with that actual person and more to do with the makeup artist. Besides that, maintaining one's appearance is a very different skill from making a convincing argument. Unfortunately, people usually see someone's appearance before hearing his or her words. One person's judgment of another can begin before words are spoken. 
Some might say that care for appearances can indicate care for substance. However, the effort put into making something look good could have been used to make that same thing more functional. People can also take advantage of the fact that you're not supposed to take something out of the box until after you buy it. Is the attractive product really worth your money, or is it just a way for some company to take your money without being accused of robbery?
If you can, please try to look beneath the surface when judging whether something is good or bad. If you plan to choose something you want to see or hear for a long time, don't leap for the first shiny object that comes along. Make sure your decision is a good one before you make the leap.","Images and impressions make more of an impact on people than they should.

While rivalry can help us win that high school chess tournament or game of Monopoly with your best friend, rivalry can also hinder our success. In order to be truly successful, or rather, to have accomplishments that last and benefit us in both the present and future, it is imperative to cooperate with others. Cooperation is beneficial in many of life's aspects, including romantic relationships, workplace success, and friendships.

Many people mistakenly believe that appearing better than others will get them a loving partner. While dating apps nowadays encourage people to display wealth, social status, and high quality photos to attract dates, these suggestions tend to backfire. Potential dates may be disappointed when they meet in person or may want to date for the wrong reasons, leading to self disappointment and a lack of love. This obession of dating rivalry distracts from the good qualities someone has and potential partners are only able to focus on superficial aspects, thus, it is more important to be true to yourself instead of comparing yourself to others in the dating realm.

In the business world, rivalry can potentially get an employee a bonus or promotion, but one must be careful not to overdo it. Excessive rivalry makes it difficult for employees to come together to solve difficult problems when unexpected challenges occur. Rivalry discourages business collaboration and hinders brainstorming new diverse ideas that could help a company thrive.

While it is always fun to have rivals in friendships, too much rivalry could potentially cause someone to lose that friendship. Friends often discuss hot topics such as politics and being overly abrasive can make your friends feel alienated and they may want to spend less time with you. Try to find a medium when discussing topics with friends that could spark disagreements; make sure to encourage sharing opinions of all kinds and go easy on the rivalry.

In short, rivalry can help us grow, but it is important to ease back on how much of it we focus on.

271,MATERIALISM,"Materialism is an aspect of modern society that encompasses the consumeristic tendencies of people in primarily industrialized nations. The reality is that people spend much of their time and energy pursuing the means to purchase more possessions, and the rest of their time is typically spent on actually purchasing and using those objects. On those terms, materialism is often criticized for its reduction of modern life to mere robotic and meaningless behaviors that extend no further than surface-level indulgences. 

Materialism does warrant the criticism it receives for many reasons, not the least of which is the exploitation that often accompanies the endless requirement for new things to sell and the resulting pursuit for enough money to buy those new things. Exploitation is not limited to workplace abuse, but also extends to environmental issues. Society's increasing concern with acquiring man-made objects that are often easily and necessarily replaceable leaves little consideration for the consequences of such unsustainable behaviors on the natural world. 

In defence of materialism, it is often argued that traditional ideals of naturalism and a return to simpler times is a fiction that simply isn't shared by the majority of people. If humanity is in a period of materialistic obsession, perhaps it should be allowed to move through that period in its own time. After all, social values will inevitably change again, as they always have in the past. However, this argument does not fully appreciate the extent of materialism's impact on humanity and the natural world. Too much emphasis on material objects simply doesn't leave enough room for human empathy (since people are more often used as a means to an end), doesn't recognize any inherent value in natural objects, and turns itself into devastating cycle of doing exhausting work to get enough money to buy something that temporarily distracts from the state of the world and one's own exhaustion. Rather than hiding from uncomfortable issues inside the pleasure of buying the newest phone or upgrading one's car, perhaps a return to spiritual actualization and the simple pleasure and value of the natural world would direct humanity's interest more effectively toward changing the things they are currently resigned to.

274,COMPETITION,"Cooperation is a fundamental building block of every society's success, whether a given individual is able to recognize this fact or not. Throughout history, there are more than a few examples that can be given.

Ancient civilization didn't thrive(or even start) by each person opposing the other at every turn; they had to cooperate to get food and water, manage resources, learn trades, and build their cities, and before that, build primitive shelters, This is evident in early civilizations such as Babylon or ancient Egypt. While these societies had their imperfections, they did last longer as a whole than various bands of thugs fighting each other ever could--nd there's a reson that such environments don't have such long, rich histories as the most thriving civilizations did.

In current societies, it's every bit as evident. Countries with more income inequality tend to have higher crime rates, partly out of desperation on the parts of those committing the criemes. Education for them is largely inadequate due to low funding. In the Scandinavian countries, there are higher rates of overall happiness for the populations of those nations. People are far more willing to redistribute unused wealth, rather than hoarding it, and the social programs are all the more successful for it.

This may not seem so apparent in America, where we're so often given lesser-of -two-evils options when voting; when Francklin Roosevelt was in power, a social democrat platform was an easy success.

The billionaires running the world now no doubt see success that would be unimaginale to most of us, but the history of the world shows that the masses are lifted up by more mutually beneficial actions and policies, It's important to look objectively at what's happened in the past and apply the empirical evidence to analysis of the current state of the world. Matters are far more complicated than the common but incorrect assumption that those at the top arrive there simply, or even mostly, due to merit.","Cooperation is a fundamental building block of every society's success, whether a given individual is able to recognize this fact or not. Throughout history, there are more than a few examples that can be given.

Ancient civilizations didn't thrive(or even start) by each person opposing the other at every turn; they had to cooperate to get food and water, manage resources, learn trades, and build their cities, and before that, build primitive shelters. This is evident in early civilizations such as Babylon or ancient Egypt. While these societies had their imperfections, they did last longer as a whole than various bands of thugs fighting each other ever could--and there's a reason that such environments don't have such long, rich histories as the most thriving civilizations did.

In current societies, it's every bit as evident. Countries with more income inequality tend to have higher crime rates, partly out of desperation on the parts of those committing the crimes. Education for them is largely inadequate due to low funding. In the Scandinavian countries, there are higher rates of overall happiness for the populations of those nations. People are far more willing to redistribute unused wealth, rather than hoarding it, and the social programs are all the more successful for it.

This may not seem so apparent in America, where we're so often given lesser-of-two-evils options when voting; when Franklin Roosevelt was in power, a social democrat platform was an easy success politically, resulting in him being elected 4 times, and his opponents insisting on term limits due to his success.  This success was mostly stemming from the fact that voters support a candidate when that candidate demonstrably improves the lives of the common people. New Deal policies were by and large in this vein, creating far more satisfaction than in societies where ""might-makes-right"" and severely deregulated economic systems are in place.

276,COMPETITION,"In a world economy driven by capitalism, it may seem counterintuitive to focus on cooperation over compensation. However, it is joining togehter that yields the most financical success. It is working with, instead of against people, that builds a stronger business community.

For those who wish to argue that competition is the better approach, there are plenty of examples. One is the self-driving car industry. It becamse a race for companies to have their services widely adopted. That race pushed technology further, faster. But at the same time, it resulted in safety problems. Pressure to win was stronger than keeping workers safe. And the competition kept industrital from sharing technology breakthroughts that could have saved precious time and effort--and maybe even lices.

The spread of giant corporations like Wal-Mart illustrate the dark side of capitalist competition. What beings as an open playing field, quickly turns into a monopoly. Large businesses that argue for access into small towns, to compete with the smaller shops, eventually drive those shops into bancruptcy by underpricing them. When all that is left are the big franchises, these locations are the only source for jobs. Unfortunately, those jobs are lower paying, with fewer benefits or none at all.

That is to say, while there are some evolutionary incentives to be selfish, they are not the only incentivies. To support this, Dawkins speaks of symbiosis, wherein different species gain mutual benefits from  one another.

Success is hard to define, through, and it takes many forms. Some forms will be helped more by competition, some by cooperation. For example, in a free market, competition drives innovation. We therefore can achieve more success by reaping the benifits of companies competing with one another to create the best products. But on the other hand, we gain a great deal from cooperation with our fellow humans. Think of social movements that have spurred massive societal changes. They happened because large amounts of people decided to cooperate in pursit of a common goal.

In2022, we're still not yet recovered from a glaobal pandemic, one that has been partially prolonged by a lack of empathy and understanding on the part of others. At the start, people with means could use their possesions - specifically, vacation homes away from population centers - as a coping mechanism to deal with the threat, but this ws simply a way of forestalling the inevitable. Holding up in a vacation villa in the Hamptons was never going to fix the problem, just push it on down the road for later. The actual solution was one that had nothing to do with how much money or properies one has, but how much value someone places on theor neighbor's life, particularly if they're less well off than they are.

There are valid critiques to be made of non-capitalist societies - for all of the advances Cuba has made in providing healthcare to their population, for example, many of these are driven by an oppressive regime that stifles dissent and jails its intellectuals. but humans aare humans, and even the best intentions can be corrupted by those seeking power by any means. This does not negate an indictment of capitalism as a predatory force.

I believe that in order to directly compare outcomes, we need to first treat equity among all strata of society as the goal that we're after. In this regard, materialism - and the capitalist underpinnings of it - has seemed to have failed us a whole in 2022.

283,HAPPINESS,"Being bhappy is what many people strive for in life. Happiness is a gift that can be shared with eeverone; but how do you find? Some people believe that happiness comes from focusing on the happiness of others. Other people believe that happiness comes internally from focusing on their own personal goals. I believe that happiness is best obtained by focusing on your own goals before anything else or prioritizing other happiness. Happiness is best obtained by focusing on your own goals because your happiness starts with you finding peace and happiness with your own self. Once you are happy yourself, it is much easier to focus on the happiness of others and therefore spearad happiness.

Many people have heard of the airplane warning ""put your mask on before helping other"" - this advice is a great analogy of happiness. You cannot help other people behappy unless you are happy yourself. Think about happiness in your day-to-day life, it is a lot easier to help other be happy when you are happy yourself. If you are in a sad mood, Imagine trying to make someone else happy. It is quite hard, isn't it? Another reason that happiness is easier when you focus on yourself first is because of the concept of self-acceptance. Everyone in life  has flaws, everyone has something they want to do better with. One cannot really be truly happy unless they accept themselves. Happiness is not something you can but at the store; it must be found internally. Only once we are truly happy with ourselves can our happiness be broadcast to others.

While the happiness of others is important, it is not what really makes people happy. Prioritizing other is a good approach to many thing in life, but if you are not happy yourself how can you prioritize the happiness of others. That is why is more important to focus on your internal goals and your own happiness before you can help others.

Happiness is the greatest feeling in the world. Everything is great, things are working out in your favor. Happiness can come from many sources, but true hapiness comes from focusing on your own goals. Only when you are happy with yourself can you share that happiness with others. The ultimate happiness comes internally.","Being happy is what many people strive for in life.  Happiness is a gift that can be shared with everyone; but how do you find it? Some people believe that happiness comes from focusing on the happiness of others.  Other people believe that happiness comes internally from focusing on their own personal goals.  I believe that happiness is best obtained by focusing on your own goals before anything else or prioritizing others happiness.  Happiness is best obtained by focusing on your own goals because your happiness starts with you finding peace and happiness with your own self.  Once you are happy yourself, it is much easier to focus on the happiness of others and therefore spread happiness.  

Many people have heard of the airplane warning ""put your mask on before helping others"" - this advice is a great analogy of happiness.  You cannot help other people be happy unless you are happy yourself.  Think about happiness in your day-to-day life, it is a lot easier to help others be happy when you are happy yourself.  If you are in a sad mood, imagine trying to make someone else happy.  It is quite hard, isn't it?  Another reason that happiness is easier when you focus on yourself first is because of the concept of self-acceptance.  Everyone in life has flaws, everyone has something they want to do better with.  One cannot really be truly happy unless they accept themselves.  Happiness is not something you can buy at the store; it must be found internally.  Only once we are truly happy with ourselves can our happiness be broadcast to others.

While the happiness of others is important, it is not what really makes people happy.  Prioritizing others is a good approach to many things in life, but if you are not happy yourself how can you prioritize the happiness of others.  That is why it is more important to focus on your internal goals and your own happiness before you can help others.  

Happiness is the greatest feeling in the world.  Everything is great, things are working out in your favor.  Happiness can come from many sources, but true happiness comes from focusing on your own goals.  Only when you are happy with yourself can you share that happiness with others.  The ultimate happiness comes internally.  ",4,0.978619154
284,MATERIALISM,"Materialism is a common factor in today's society, and it is something that we often frown upon and cast scorn and hatred toward. It seems that having too many possessions, or in fact, having too many possessions thatwe are attached to or proud of, is something that most people would argue is unnecessary. Thequestion becomes, should this materialism be the center of our scorn and upset, or should we really understand it as a function of our capitalist society? Materialism is just a by product of a society geared toward selling and using products.
We all know that most of the world operates with a corporate mentality of ""what can this get me?"" We all are working and spending our most precious resource - our time - to gain monry with which to buy any other resource we need. At the end of the day, all the things that we are spending money on are relatively ""materialistic"" needs. We have adapted over the years and as we adapt and learn, we are producing more things that we have to spend money to buy. This materialism extends not just to products like internet, clothing, and vehicles. Some would say that we ""need"" these things in order to function in our society, but wouldn't that actually make materialism a function of society? There was not previouslyba need for internet- there was a time when it didn't exist. There wasnot always a need for vehicles- they did not always exist. So is materialism as we see it really to be as scorned as we make it?
In summary, materialism has evolved over the years along with our industry and capitalist society. It has become a function of how we determine whether someone is successful in the capitalist society in which we find ourselves.

285,MATERIALISM,"Saying that someone is materialistic is generally considered to be an insult. It insinuates that the person is shallow and lacks the depth of character that is crucial for a person to fully appreciate non material things. These insinuations are so fitting when it comes to modern society that I feel quite confident in saying that our modern society is wholly too materialistic.

In modern society people have lost sight of non material things such as spending time with family and friends, spending time in nature, engaging in hobbies, volunteering, helping others, and just sitting quietly with one's thoughts. People in our modern society are much more interested in ""keeping up with the Jones's"" than they are with partaking in non material experiences. It is far more important to people in modern society to have material possessions than it is to not.

From a young age people in our society are taught materialism. From the moment a child is placed in front of a television or mobile device they are bombarded with advertisements. These advertisements teach a child that happiness comes from material possessions; if you had this toy you would be happy, if you had this cereal you would be happy, if you went to this place you would be happy, etc.

All too often this early exposure to and encouragement of materialism carries on into adulthood. People are constantly seeking that next material item to bring them happiness instead of seeking happiness from non material experiences. I think that this is why you are more likely to see people shopping than you are to see people relaxing in a park.

Material is not entirely negative, however. Some degree of materialism is necessary for human survival. If a person did not, for example, seek out the material goods necessary for daily life it is unlikely that they would live for long. If a person failed to seek out things such as water, food, shelter, and clothing they would die.

Materialism is also beneficial for capitalism. If people in modern society did not constantly seel out material possessions that they do not need many businesses would not survive.

Despite its few benefits I still feel that materialism is a negative aspect in the lives of many people in modern society and that it is something that should not be encouraged. When people look to external material possessions for happiness and satisfaction they lose sigh of the non material things that truly matter in life; family, friends, nature, etc.

People don't know any better. As kids, people are told to buy every toy, and then people get older and they're told to buy every snack, all the clothes, all the cars, and much more. So I don't think many people really think about it all that much. I think mentally, it is in people's minds and they don't second guess their behavior.

It is hard to criticize modern society for being materialistic because people have been trained and forced their entire lives to know nothing else. They use it to cope with their problems and feel good, so it's not good to judge people so much for it.",4,0.985205733

One exmple would be contributing to a charity, whether through monetary donations or personal labor. If you can see the happiness of others, it should make you feel a certain sense of satisfaction. Even if you don't see the results, you might feel good imagining them. In my case, I give money every month to the Vincentian Congregation to sponsor a semininarian i India.

Working for an environmental organization could be pleasant too. If you are able to secure a position in a positively geared organization- Say one for plucking plastics out of thr ocean- that could be satisfying and would make you happy in the long run. Think how good it must feel to have been part of thr work that's closing that hole in thr ozone! That's so wonderful. Cleaning up the junk floating out in space is probably also satisying.

Some people focus on achieving happiness by turning the focus inward on themselves. Others, on the other hand, choose to focus on things often than themselves in this pursuit.

Despite the two sides that are presented, it is evident that people are more likely to achieve the end goal of happiness if they focus less on themselves. Although it can seem counterintuitive at first glance, focusing on the happiness of others is a surefire way of making sure one achieves it oneself. This is when concepts such as altuism and selflessness comes into play, helping achieve a level of happiness that transcends that which would occur if one soley focused on oneself. This is not to say that personal achievement don't amount to anything - of course, one can achieve a great deal of joy when one become a lawyer or becomes fluent in a new language. This kind of happiness, however, can almost seem superficial compared to the one that results when you don't focus on just your own happiness. For example, putting a genuine smile on someon's face is something that may not take as much time as learning a new language but can set your own heart smiling instead.

The frequency of posts and volume of opportunities for a person to feel less because they are not as beautiful or as active, or as cool as the images they view at times for hours a day has created new mental health issues.

 I used to think that others could make me happy if I hung out with the right people. Not so-I have definitely learned that I am much happier if I just concentrate on my own goals with my job and how I interact with others who are friends. One reason is that others really have no idea how to make you happy. No one is a mind reader. You can only make others happy by being happy yourself. No one wants to be around someone who is not happy, so if you are happy, you are more likely to make others happy without even trying. My position is to definitely pay attention to the things that make you happy and then the happiness of the people you are around will follow. I have found that if I concentrate on myself first, then I am not so stressed if I make myself happy first by doing my best work in my job and taking care for my pets. I do not feel responsible for others as much when I concentrate on my work and pets. Being happy myself bring others into a better mood when I am not complaining. So this is a very good argument for focusing on your happiness before you attempt to make others happy.

Some people might say that they would rather make others happy rather than concentrating just on themselves. How do you actually know what makes others happy? A counterargument might be that you feel better about yourself as a person if you focus on thers more. You might feel that your are a good person and not a selfish person. If you actually like to do things for others first, so if this is your idea of being more happy, then first, so if this is your idea of being more happy, then go for it. A goof place to start if you want to feel happier by making others happy is to definitely ask the person about the things that make them happy. This is a good tip for being successsful in making them happy before yourself. You will not fail if you actually ask them about their likes and dislikes when trying to make someone else happy before yourself. Failure is not an option if you are attempting to make happiness for another before yourself. Happiness does not come with failure.

It works both ways when trying to be happy. Ask yourself what makes your the most happy along with asking what makes another person happy. Create your list for both options if you think that concentratingon your own happiness is best for you, or a  list if you believe that in order for you to be  happy yourself, you must concentrate on others first.

300,APPEARANCE,"In the modern world, individuals are bombarded with many sights and sounds attempting to gain thier attention. Through multiple methods, images impact our daily lives. As media has grown in the digital and internet age, individuals' self worth and spending habits have been affected. The purpose of this essay is to explore two different ways these images may affect teenagers and adults today.

Teenagers today have pressures that many older people may have never imagined. The constant presence of social and digital media including the effect of influencers promoting certain views, looks, and styles, often places undue presures on youth. The images online and in the media frequently only represent a fraction of the real life hiding behind the camera or computer. However, this facade is not always readily apparent and young people may feel presured to live up to a certain standard of perfection as modeled in these media settings. This places an enormous burden on teenagers to live up to an unobtainable standard and may result in feelings of anxiety, depression, and poor self worth.

In addition, adults can be negatively impacted by advertising and media influence, particularly in the arena of marketing. Many individuals may be swayed by buy products simply based on packaging on claims made by brand representatives. One has to cautiously interpret data available on media through a lens of self doubt and scientific inquiry in order to reveal what is true and what is simply utilized as a marketing tool. In some ways, this seems manipulative of companies but is likely just the nature of doing business in a capitalist marketplace. Businesses have their own challenge trying to catch the attention of an increasingly distracted and media-savyy public in a competitive market.

In conclusion, images can negatively impact the lives of people today by promoting a false or confusing reality. Teenagers and adults should consider the reality behind the screen before placing undue presures upon themselves to live up to an unobtainable standard of perfection or purchase certain products.

302,MATERIALISM,"Materialism is a love\\ hate fact of life.Some people buy things to feel better about themselves or to fill a void. In moderation this isn't a negative. Over consuption is where the problem lies. That is why people hate materialism.It's not that it's just stuff, it's that there's  an over abundance of unneccessary stuff.

Life cannot be all about work.There needs to be a balance. Consuming products helps maintaince the ability  to not burn oneself out. At some point in the grand scheme of life it became more about work and less about enjoying the fruits of your labor. People became unhappy. Those  that turn to materialistic items get a nice dopamine hit that usually never lasts longer than a day so they buy more stuff. Repeating this process can lead to debt. That debt than leads to more unhappiness and the vicious cycle endures another round. Meanwhile all this stuff piles up and eventually makes its way to a landfill. That is not good for anyone as there is only so much garbage this earth can hold. I  understand that money makes the world go round but maybe it's a break. stop letting greed dictetate the furture of mankind.

Materialism should absolutely be criticised but it needs to be addressed in a way that people don't tune out the  message. Balance needs to be brought back so people don't feel the  need to buy their way out of their way out of their feelings. Work needs to stop being the the all consuming beast that it is so people can be happier. A well rested and mentally healthy populae is a benefit to us all. That's where innovation thrives.

305,HAPPINESS,"People find happiness in a variety of ways. Each human being is unique, and something that makes one person happy may not make the next person happy. Some people find happiness in pursuing their own personal interests, whether their pursuit is focused on business or pleasure. Other people find happiness in focusing on the needs and desires of others, on helping others in a variety of ways.
I believe most people are likely to be happy if they focus on their own personal interests rather than other people or humanity as a whole. Human beings are inherently selfish. We come from a background of selfishness essentially focused on our own survival. This is evidenced by the sympathetic nervous system, the fight or flight response that has survived thousands if not millions of years of human evolution. We must look after ourselves first. After all, if we are not well, we become unable to help others.
Many people believe the opposite to be true: people find th most value in life, and therefore the most happiness from helping others. While it is true that, for most people, helping others will bring about positive feelings, the number of people who genuinely find happiness in helping others as their primary focus without regard for their own personal happiness is relatively small. Those who build their life around helping others and putting oters first may appear happy most of the time, but many of them have deep regrets about not pursuing their own personal interests. One cannot be genuinely happy while holding regret.
A parent may build their life around their offspring and seem happy most of the time, while they privately ponder how things would be different if they had done this or that thing that they believe would make their life better. A person may work for a non-profit or put in an unbelievable number of hours in a healthcare practice, a thing which has the potential to make some people vary happy while helping many others, while exhausting themselves or overworking themselves to a point where they feel like their life is no longer their own, and at this point where they feel like their life is no longer their now, and at this point they may even lose their purpose altogether.
When people meet their own needs first, and when they find satisfaction within their own life, they will experience happiness.

306,COMPETITION,"I believe people achieve more success by cooperation. Having someone who you can count on is a building block to success.

At an early age one learns usually through parents who teach and guide and show how things are done by example. If nobody was there to teach, there would be either no learning or learning wrong or it would take longer to figure out on ones own. You go to school and learn by teachers teaching you various subjects and skills. That is why a teacher is called a teacher. You cooperate with them by listening and doing assignments to grasp knowledge. A teacher is cooperating with you as they are showing and telling you how its done. This is all done so that one can achieve success and be able to function in this world.

Some would say that competition is a better way to achieve success. In a few instances this might be true as some are driven by competition to achieve more. However, the vast majority fo success is achieved by cooperation. One has to have cooperation through a parent, teacher, mentor, coach, leader, fellow employee, etc. before one can ever get to the point of a competitive situation. In sports a game, match, meet, championship, etc. is done through competition but there must be cooperation first. Cooperation with teammates or say in tennis where one is competing individually, first there was cooperation with a coach, practice partner, trainer, dietician, etc. One could not get to the competing stage before first being on the cooperation stage.

At work we recently received new software. In order to learn the software first a representative from the software company came and showed us the basics of how the software operates. For several days he was there to show us and answer any questions we had. Videos of how to use the software were also made available for after the representative left. The representatives phone number was provided in case we had further questions after the representative left. If one of us learned how to use a feature then we would show the others that feature. This is how the software was learned and how eventual success was achieved. The representative didn't come in and say that he was forming us into teams and the first team to learn the software without any help from him was the winner. Obviously that would have been a recipe for failure or at best it would have taken a whole lot longer to learn the software. Key features could have been missed or we could have learned a tougher way to do things, not taking advantage of a simpler method or by not utilizing all the functions the software had to offer.

309,MATERIALISM,"I do think that modern society should be criticized for materialism in some aspects. I think materialism should be criticized when it is clear that there are detrimental effects of it. For example, I think those detrimental effects can appear when materialism causes and overwhenlming demand for something, adn that demand cannot be met or that demand causes a burden of destruction on resources. Consumerism and capitalism contributes to this issue as well. 
An example of this is the demand of Playstation 5 game systems. Early on in the COVID pandemic , when the systems were released, there were not enough to meet supply. Materialism was part of the reason for this. Several people wanted to hoard the game systems and sell them at an astronomical markup. People who wanted to purchase a system for entertainment could not do so because scalpers continuously wiped out supply at retailers and online. While gaming systems are not necessarily a life necessity (such as food, water, and shelter), the gaming sysytems provide(d) a high-level of enteretainment for people. People value entertainment, and entertainment was considered an especially valuable commodity during the time where most of the country (U.S) was forced to shelter indoors and many venues for entertainment such as thearters, stadiums, etc. were shutdown.
In contrast, there are some people that believe that materialism helps the economy since materialism helps to create the demand of rproducts/services to  be created in the first place. While that may be true in some aspects, amterialism and consumerism absolutely can get out of control and causes more harm than good. In reference to the PS5 exampel I used earlier, both consumerism and materialism contributed to the problem.

310,APPEARANCE,"People are too easily influenced by what they see and what they are told.

Influencers have strong control over their followers; their followers take them at their word without careful consideration.  They don't stop to think that those influencers are being rewarded by the companies they promote.  They just want to be like that influencer.

When manufacturers determine how to get people to purchase their products, the packaging is very often more important than the quality of the product.  They ask potential consumers to rate their packaging, tell them what they like and/or dislike about the packing, how to improve the packaging, without a single word about what's inside the packaging and how they can improve that.  They rely upon sales numbers to tell them if the product is okay or if it needs improving.  What the consumer sees, rather than what he/she knows about the package's contents, is what frequently drives a person to buy a product in the first place.

Television ads try to draw the consumer in, by seeming to make a connection between the people in the ads and the viewer, i.e., a frantic mother, making the viewer think the product in question will make their life better.  If you buy their product, you will be happier and healthier.

Politicians are another example of appearances infuencing people, often with intention.  Politicians apper to be happy, friendly, compassionate, when you know that as soon as they are out of the public eye, their whole demeanor changes.  And who is going to vote for a ugly politician?!  Attractiveness is an asset in getting elected.  If people know nothing about the choices of candidates and are getting ready to vote, they're going to go with the most handsome/prettiest.

Too often actors and actresses are judged by their actions, deeds, woprds, and looks, rather than on their abilities.  Our favorite actors and actresses are generally the most handsome/prettiest/ People don't seem to realize that you can appreciate someone's talent without liking them personally.  Unfortunately, that leads to poor quality television and movies, but, hey, the people are nice to look at.

For all these reasons, people need to carefully examine what they see before making judgments and decisions.  What you see is not necessarily what you get.","People are too easily influenced by what they see and what they are told.  

Influencers have strong control over their followers; their followers take them at their word without careful consideration.  They don't stop to think that those influencers are being rewarded by the companies they promote.  They just want to be like that influencer.

When manufacturers determine how to get people to purchase their products, the packaging is very often more important than the quality of the product.  They ask potential consumers to rate their packaging, tell them what they like and/or dislike about the packing, how to improve the packaging, without a single word about what's inside the packaging and how they can improve that.  They rely upon sales numbers to tell them if the product is okay or if it needs improving.  What the consumer sees, rather than what he/she knows about the package's contents, is what frequently drives a person to buy a product in the first place.

Television ads try to draw the consumer in, by seeming to make a connection between the people in the ads and the viewer, i.e., a frantic mother, making the viewer think the product in question will make their life better.  If you buy their product, you will be happier and healthier.

Politicians are another example of appearances influencing people, often with intention.  Politicians appear to be happy, friendly, compassionate, when you know that as soon as they are out of the public eye, their whole demeanor changes.  And who is going to vote for an ugly politician?!  Attractiveness is an asset in getting elected.  If people know nothing about the choices of candidates and are getting ready to vote, they're going to go with the most handsome/prettiest.

312,HAPPINESS,"I have been doing small tasks in my community for over a decade.  I wanted  to raise my children to learn that kindness goes a long way, and brings you sense of happiness and peace. I led by example. From collecting canned goods for a food bank to becoming a PTA president, I have had my share of making others happy. It is rewarding, but I have discovered there is a little voice in the back of my head that says, ""what about me?"" more than once. Is the neglect of my own personal needs taking a backseat to making others happy?


Happiness cand be found in many things in life, but until you take the time to feed your own soul, I believe a person cannot truly be happy. Some dreams are out of reach as you age, but small goals will give you a sense of accomplishment on your path to happiness.


In my time as a PTA president, a staff member at the school was diagnosed with cancer. To help her, I threw a community bingo night, raising several thousand dollars for the treatment. The happiness and joy I felt giving her that money was incredible. But, taht little voice was still in my head. I had not dealt with the grief I had experienced with my own family member's cancer struggle. I was happy for someone else, but I wasn't truly happy myself. I discovered the only healthy way to help myself was to put my happiness first. I got through this dilemna by talking about my grief, telling people open and honestly I am ""over it"" and doing as well as they assume I am. Until I could get my feelings out in the open, I was not a happy person inside. I have been told many times that I have done wonderful things in the community, but I didn't really believe I made an impact until I was able to find inner peace.


Some will say that if you do enough good in the world, you will become happier. I agree with this, to a point. Leave your mark, make people think of you fondly, greet other with a smile... you have surely heard all of these statements and more. They're true, but until you can wake up in the morning and be genuinely happy to be alive, nothing you do will truly make the impact you're hoping for. Your momentary feeling of happiness will escape just as quickly as you found it if you aren't taking time for your own needs.


What is the secret to happiness? Starting from within. It's easy for me to throw a party for 300 elementary school children and be able to relish in their smiles. One thing I have learned is that personal goals can be some of the hardest ones you will ever meet in your lifetime. Whether it be weight loss, eating better, or going for a simple walk around the block, we put off the most important things for ourselves because we are simply too busy, or don't want to make that time.

314,HAPPINESS,"What would be your answer if I asked you where true happiness comes from? You might be tempted to say fulfilling your goals, being successful, or even making yourself your number one priority. I think true happiness and fulfillment comes from spreading it, giving as much to others as you possibly can.

Many people have tunnel vision on their own successes. They look out for themselves and along the way forget the need for genuine connection. There's no better way to do that than by going out of your way to help someone - whether it be by being there for someone in a time of need, surprising someone with something nice, or doing something like community service to enrich the lives of others. Personal successes still have meaning, but giving happiness to others creates unmatched fulfillment. When it comes down ti it - when the people around you are happy, you tend to be happy as well.

Some people may say the only person who will be truly there for you throughout your life is yourself - so it's better to focus on your own happiness. This couldn't be further from the truth. Humans have a need for connection to others, and if we just looked out for ourselves this wouldn't be possible as we would be viewed as selfish. Others may claim it's not possible to give others happiness unless we are happy ourselves. This is also not true. Some of the people in the worst spots have hearts of gold and wouldn't hesitate to help out in a moment's notice. People who know what struggle feels like generally don't want others to go through similar experiences, and will help others to not have to feel that struggle, in turn giving them fulfillment and happiness.

It may seem counterproductive to some to focus on others' happiness, we get fulfillment from the good deed, in turn making us happy. If the many people of the world were less focused on their personal successes and more focused on the successes and well being of the world as a whole, there wouldn't be such a strong desire to focus on ourselves so much in the first place. After all, when everyone around you is happy, it's hard not to be. It tends to be infectious. It may seem simple or even corny, but in a species where connection is nearly necessary, others' happiness is all of our happiness.","What would be your answer if I asked you where true happiness comes from?

This is paricularly noted in anual rankngs of global wealth of individuals, nobel prizes to individuals, and other means of comparison of peoples success.

While rivalry and competition may offer a push to do better in some circumstances, it is ultimately cooperation that drives the effort to achieve more in the long term.

Materialism has todo with place value on meterial items that we purchase.Some find happiness in meteriastic things;wheras,others don't consider placing such a high value on such things. So the question being;Should society be criticized for being materialistic?  personally, I feel that what it comes down to is that each indidual person should do whatever it is thst makes them feel joy and that they shouldnt be judged for doing so.What one person choose to find joy in should have no influence on how another person views them.finding joy in materilistic things has nothing to do with the character of that person.Just because they enjoy physical items, doesnt mean that they don't have feelings for others or that don't enjoy experiences as well. Let's say for example that someone just their pet. As part of their grieving process,they went out and purchased a necklace that has their pets name engraved in it and they value nacklace very much.Does that make them materialstic? i think not.However, lets turn the tables and take sentimental value out of the picture.Someone goes out shopping one day and purchases a necklace that they thought was cute and brings them joy. Your initial thought is probably, oh that I can see where you're coming from.However,what one chooses to do with their money should be their own business and they should never be judged in doing so.

People should onlyb be criticized for materialism when they are making inefficient use of resoiurces. Humans are expected by society to be productivity, so materialism is fine (within  reason) if it helps someone to do that.

Take for example, a Macbook Pro. It is a device that is the quintessence of materialism. however, many people rely on this tool to earn a living. They use it to earn thousands, if not millions of dollars per year.Same idea with a camera. If they always buy the newest camera on the market, should they be criticized for being materialistic if they use their cameras to earn millions from posting Youtube videos?

I believe one is more likely to achieve hapiness by focusing on their own goals first, because if you don't take care of your own hapiness first then you cannot help others.

Focusing on yourself may seem selfish, but you can always help others after you have achieved your dreams. In fact you can help them more. For example if you become an attorney yu can allow someone to apprentice inder you. If you spend your whole life campaigning for charities and waving signs around it is unlikely you will ever achieve the wealth or influence to affect actual change. Mazlow's hierarchy of needs explicitly implies that if you don't take care of your needs first, it's basically impossible to be happy or satisfied.

Without the proper resources and your own well being met it is simply impossible to achieve happiness, let lone help others. I believe happiness is much more likely to come from focusing on your own goals, because there's no viable way to achieve the goals of others without your own being met.

In conclusio many people will chastise those who seek to better themselves, they may call them cutthroat, they may call them greedy, but these same people often do much good i the world.

Cooperation allows each individual to provide their best efforts and excel using their personal attributes. Let's look at a group assigned the task of creating a presentation to reflect the company's quarterly sales. In a cooperative workplace the different elements of this task would be assigned to persons with specific strengths. Those who excel at maths would compile the data. Those who are proficient with PowerPoint would create the presentation. The individual without a fear of public speaking would present the report to upper managment. The cooperative group is motivated by the success of the team as whole and not fear of personal failure.

Many claim that competition is a way to idenitfy  the  strong from the weak. Competition creates a drive to succeed and will compel people to work harder. However, in the long run competition will create employees who are disengaged and more prone to burnout. Long term goals would not be met, because the team is constant working harder and not smarter.

While the debate between competition and cooperation may never have a clear answer, it is clear that long term success is best achieved through cooperation.

          Pre-1980, most households were single earners.  The women took care of the cooking, cleaning, gardening, and child raising.  Now, we have to pay someone else for all those things while we spend most of our free time working for someone else.  All because we desire monies to buy materialistic goods.   Not only is our happiness suffering, so is our health.  Our families are overworked, underpaid, tired, and unhealthy.  Why do we keep pursuing this desire for more things when it is slowly killing us?
          Worldwide, we need to stop consuming.  Let's get back to the good old days when our goods lasted for decades instead of months.  We know that we do not enjoy working, we all crave time off.  What if the secret to having happiness was to stop buying all the things we see advertised?  ",4,0.964830508
329,APPEARANCE,"People are vulnerable to the outward appearance of things and persons, forming impressions about their desirability or other qualities Frequently upon closer inspection, these things or people do not live up to their outward appearance which can serve to disappoint, or in some cases reassure the observer that the grass really isn't greener.

Friends or neighbors can display impressions of wealth that can make us envious of their lives. Sometimes that outward appearance can be genuine, but quite often the glamorous life can be subsidized by tremendous debt which can be causing a great deal of stress that can reach a breaking point. Sometimes this life has to be supported by people who work long hours at the sacrifice of their family life. Relationships can become broken and children can turn to drugs or other destructive behaviors. When we discover things aren't quite what they seem, it can make us grateful for what we have and that we don't really envy them after all.

Very often we envy celebrities for their beauty, fame, and riches. These outward appearances are often manufactured by hosts of makeup artists, plastic surgeons, public relations people, and a host of other professionals. We see these people perform in movies or television and believe they are who they portray. The real person within is frequently suffering emotionally and is a prisoner of their fame in that they can't go about their life normally like most of us do. It wouldn't at all be surprising that many of them envy those of us who are just everyday people.

Physical objects can also present a beautiful exterior which can mask poor quality within. OFten some of the most expensive cars look beautiful and offer many amenities, but can be extremely expensive to maintain or repair. Many times the long term reliability o these cars is poor. Designer bags or shoes can be objects of desire, but shoes and bags from ordinary retailers serve their purpose just as well.

Without doubt there is always someone more attractive, richer, more popular, smarter, and so on than we are.

Expensive consumer products lure us with their appeal to help identify with the rich and amous.

330,HAPPINESS,"To understand if one is truly ''happy'' , we must first define how happiness is measured. Arguably, happiness looks different and feels different to everyone. Something that  may bring you overwhelming joy and elation may have no effect on a different individual. In order to aid in other peoples happiness you need to know if you are happy first. The only way to truly measure if one is happy, is to look at their personal goals and see if they have achieved them True happiness is obtained when you set goals for yourself, and you reach those goals.

Alternatively, others have argued that happiness is found during the attempt to make others happy. This may help you achieve temporary happiness, or the general feeling of happiness for a short moment, but this will not last. You cannot feel content with your own self and life when you have spent all of your time trying to improve others. Additionally, you may not have the ability to aid in others happiness if you are not truly happy with  yourself first. For example, if a friend wants your help raising moey for homeless veterans, but you are having financial strain and decide to help her anyways, would this bring you happiness? We know for certain this action would make your friend happy, which the opposition would argue should make you happy as well. However, this would only cause further financial strain on your life and negatively impact you, not allowing you to experence this second hand happiness you should feel for your friend. Now imagine this situation in life. Your friend then approaches you with a request for a donation towards the homeless veterans, you happily oblige which makes you feel even better because it did not cause you any personal strain, and it helped your friend.

The phrase we have heard many times is ''you cannot helpl others if you cannot help yourself''. If  you have ever rode on an airplane, you are probably familiar with the flight attendents safety instructions-you are instructed to put on your own air mask in case on an emergency before putting on anyone elses mask for them. This goes for your life as well, you need to be happy with yourself before you can truly be  happy with yourseld before you can truly be happy for others.

332,COMPETITION,"I think people achieve more success by competiting, butpossibly more people achieve success by cooperation. Competition means that not everyone wins, not everyone wins, not everyone succeeds, but those that do are the best of the best. Competition is everywhere, in sports, in school, in family game nights, and even in courtship behaviors. Just about everywhere you go there's competition of some sort. I, personally, think competition is the best way to garner success. People are more successful through competition.

There is competition literally everywhere. When kids in school first start realizing they like other kids in a way they want a partnership but their best friend feels the same way about the same person, that produces competition to win the persons heart. In the end, the best person wins the heart of the person they were interested in. The bad thing is that those people may not be friends anymore, afterward.

Sports is a way that competition garners few victories but they huge victories but they are are huge victories to those that win. Take, for instance, the superbowl. All of the games that were played all year long up until that point were the best teams playing against each other with only one winner. This eventually leads to the Superbowl, which is the best competing against each other knowing there will only be one winner. This makes people train harder, and win harder.

The other side of the story is that through cooperation more people win. The cooperation of those Superbowl team players of the winning team are the reason the team won. Without cooperation from all of those players, the team would have lots. It takes the whole team to win, therefore cooperation allowed success for multiple people whereas competition made for a team that was loser.

I do think that, in the end, competition is the better way to get success in most circumstances, however I think without cooperation most competition isn't even possible. Competition forces people to pull things from everywhere, get the strength they didn't know they had, come up with ideas they didn't know they could think of. Competition makes winners and the winners earned every second of their victory. So says the person who is always on both sides of the fence. I, for one, enjoy a little competiton.

I have spoken to some black American friends who expressed the myriad of emotions associated with Bill Cosby's downfall, taking into account the heinous nature of his actions against women, using his stardom to overpower women to doing his sexual bidding, and the fact that he was a promient black figure shown to be a sham. He was a father figure t the black community, a hero, and icon, who represented a lot of the best of black culture in America, now relegated to the painful, excruciating reminder of the backbreaking stereotypes of aggressive, dangerous black men, who are out to terrorise white women and seen as a threat to society. He realized the deepest fears of so many black individuals in America, and you could hear the collective societal groan watching Mr. Cosby summarily deny multiple accounts of his sexual crimes, further demeaning women, and bolstering racial sterotypes that have stood for so long.

Bill Cosby's downfall reminds me of the old adage that the label doesn't always match the content of its' character.

Make-believe is just what Bill Cosby's character turned out to be. And this is a stark reminder that what we see on screen of a public persona does not often match the reality of who that person really is behind closed doors.

I can't help but feel personal sorrow to see one of my childhood heroes fall in such an Icharuthian way and imagine the rest of society feels reticent to trust and believe in another person of that magnitude again witnessing such a tragic unveiling of his true life events. The juxtaposition of comedy and horror is startling when we think about the on-screen presentation versus the off-screen reality. Watching Bill Cosby do his jello pudding pop voice for the hundredth time from the comfort of our own homes, made up split our sides laughing, while women were suffering in a dark room being forced and coerced into sexually degrading behavior.

337,HAPPINESS,"I find that happiness can be a fairly broad definition one persons""happy"" could be another persons""depressed"".  ""But for themo most   part in general, I think it""s possible to focus on personal goals  AND still help with the happiness of others.  Like everything, with enough balance, Ifind it fairly easy to achieve these goalsd, particularlly if one of my goals happens to be the happiness of someone else.

I think that in order to really help others,you have to be willing (and able) to help yourself. If you can do things that make you happy,itgoing to likely affect  your outlook on the rest of the world. I'VE noticed that people who are sad most of the time aren't really doing much to get themselves out of that situation.  There's no ""magic bullet'' or easy solution to this-everyone is different. But for mysself,if I can manage to do something that pleases me or increases myu own happiness, I feel that I would be much more likely to be successful at it as well. 

For example, I am under no real onligation to watch over some frienmds of mine that were shared by my late fiance. But because of what I learned from her hilping and giving nature, I feel better about myself if it turns out I  can help this couple, even if it's something small like a ride ti the store, or lending an ear when they; have aproblem. I know from my own experienxce that Ifeel better after helping someone out,as it sets me up to do the next nice thi;ng for myself, which again turns to being willing and ready to hlp someone else out. It's like anice little cycle of helping ones' self while still looking out for others. I can honestly say that I don't know that I would be like this aty this time in my life if I hadn't met and experience thjhis with my late fiance.

I think that in life, the cliches are usually such because while they may in fact be cliches, they also usuallly turn own happiness by increasing the happiness of someone else. But that doesn't mean you ignore taking care of your own happiness, independent of others. It just means that if you are caring enough to make sure your own nedds are met, then you can truly help others that need it as well.","I find that happiness can be a fairly broad definition; one persons ""happy"" could be another persons ""depressed.""

Many fans of sports rave about the paly, and will watch reruns laughing with their friends about how cool the player is, but the player in fact didn't help the team win during those plays.

In the media, clips of political advertisements are used to pursuade voters to vote a particular way, but those advertisement do not tell the whole story. For example, they can be taken out of context. They can be used to smear a candidate. They can be used to impact the way a bill is viewed by voters when it comes to vote for it in congress. But most voters don't know what's in the entire bill. They only hear what the media wants them to hear.

These impressions can make people think a certain way when they don't know the whole story. When they think it's cool to just make the highlight reel, but not do what's best for the team. That a clip that's posted to social media is all the information they need to hear about a subject. That being cool or winning an argument is more important than being knowledgeable or hard working. Because those things aren't going to land working. Because those things aren't going to land on TikTok. Those things are boring. Those things don't drive up views and gain followers.

The ads that ran for his cammpaign showed himm in front of the US flag like he was a great American. People believed these ads and campaigns and he had his own following that later became almost cult-like. Yet, when he became President, he showed a different side more so than during the election. This was not what Americans were waiting for. This was a President that was a narcissist and a racist. He had no tact and he was not a financial wizard like most people believed. He had filed for bankruptcy at least twice prior so how did this make him a financial Wizard?

Most did not believe that priests could have done all these horrible things they were being accused of. Unfortunately, most of what priests had been accused of was proven to be accurate and worst of all, the Church hid it from the puvlic and usually just moved the priests from one parish to another to avoid any scandals instead of turning these people over to the police to be prosecuted.

If one devotes time and energy to supporting one's family, the reward is true happiness. In addition, if one devotes time and energy to helping one's community, the reward is also true happiness. Often a family is dependent on the support that it receives, be it time or work or money. Selflessly making the effort to provide for those needs of one's family comes back in the form of happiness, a rewad that does not even require a thank you. The same holds true for working selflessly in one's community, be it voting or picking up litter or volunteering. Delivering food to home bound seniors with the Meals On Wheels program fills the volunteer with happiness just knowing that the elderly are being checked up on for their own safety and not just for delivering a meal.

One could argue that these efforts are selfish attempts to bolster one's ego, believing these efforts are just a way for the giver to look in the mirror and justify giving as a way to avoid guilt should one not provide the aid.

341,HAPPINESS,"Happiness is a nebulous thing. Often, people disagree with the source of true happiness. The simplest example people think of is the ability to satiate their own deepest desires - love, money, a big house, good food, and unlimited power. However, there is much more to life than what you can get for yourself. While personal goals are important, the happiness of those around you cannot be overlooked.

The emotions of others has a strong impact on the way you feel. Imagine that you grow up in poverty. Your parents spend all their time working. Or, perhaps, you are an adult with a partner who spends all their time working. They are always on edge because they aren't living their true life. You sense their misery as soon as they come in the door. This occurs night after night. You absorb all their worries about life, your finances, and the future. You soon start feeling unhappy, too. On the other hand, you can give this to your partner, siblings, parents, friends, or anyone else around you. Your mood has such a strong impact on others. It is difficult to be happy when everyone is around you. It's no secret, for instance, that many relationships fail because of money problems. The unhappiness from a bad situation has a way of getting passed around. Once that resolves, people become happier and act in a much more prosocial way. Relationships succeed because people make one another happy.

Our immediate need for gratification is powerful. However, there is evidence that this runs out over time. People who achieve a certain level of wealth don't get any happier. This is because they have nothing left to gain, nothing left to prove. Their immediate needs are met. Now, they want something more. They feel unhappy because they are idle. Their meager activities stop being effective. This is because the activities they are involved in often lack meaning. Business ventures, for instance, aren't impactful. Think of Bill Gates going into Microsoft every day. All of a sudden, life is the same, day in and day out. Money isn't personal fulfillment. When you reach your earthly goals, you look for something more spiritual, and that typically is the ability to mate others happy. This is why so many people turn to charity.

Rich or poor, people give to charity. Not only is it a social obligation, but it is also a fulfilling one. Whether you're donating your time or your money, you are having an impact on those around you. This is because, deep down, everyone is part of a community. Without a functional community, we are alone. The individual is small compared to the greater good. This is why we enjoy going online to look at heartwarming videos and other sources of shared happiness. Even things like social media exist, ostensibly, to connect people. Personal happiness becomes quite shallow when held next to the potential to spread joy to others.

When it comes to living a personally fulfilling life, the happiest people have the happiest home lives. They live in harmony with their partners and the others around them. This tends to be the ultimate goal people dream of, growing up, because all we know is love. We are raised to love through our parents and get great satisfaction out of our home lives, the real constant behind whatever is going on in the world. The values of capitalism can be taught, but family and friends are consistent around the world. If you lack that, you will struggle to be happy, no matter how good your personal life looks on the surface. Ask an individual who calls themselves forever alone or an incel. They crave the reflective joy of others. Some of these people are very successful but not happy because they feel so alone. They really want to be part of something greater. While finding a partner is an individual goal, it does relate to something greater than ourselves. The same rule applies to children who grow up in broken homes or adults stuck in bad situations. They may have goals they want to accomplish, but they are really looking for something bigger than themselves.

If you are stuck around miserable people, you will be miserable. If you community is bad, you will feel bad. No one in this life can go it alone. No man is an island, as the saying goes. We each have a responsibility to the collective, and this is mutually beneficial. All our goals of work and worry are nothing compared to what we gain from giving back.

342,MATERIALISM,"Modern society should be criticized for being materialistic because it does more harm than good. The high level of materialism that we have in modern society causes numerous problems. It creates an enormous amount of waste. It creates tension in society based on who has more things, who has better things, and who has newer things. It creates an often false and fleeting sense of happiness when one acquires something new. It teahces youth to value items more than interactions and relationships. Overall, the negatives of materialism far outweigh the positives.

First of all, this materialistic mentality that the majority of people in current society have has led to the idea that we always need to have newer and better things. This leads to so much waste. The landfills are overfilled with garbage, and a large portion of that are items that have outlived their desirability and have been replaced with newer items. Our materialism also creates a sense that people who have more are better people. They are often looked up to for what they own rather than their character. This also makes people with less feel bad about themselves, and they end up spending so much time and money trying to obtain better items, that they miss out on many experiences that could bring them real joy and happiness. All too often, one makes the realization late in life that all the material objects they have acquired really did not bring them the happiness they thought it would.

One might argue that if buying and acquiring items brings people some bit of happiness, then what harm is it, but it does cause harm. It leads to social inequalities, mental distress, and harm to the planet. Of course, having things that brings a person joy would not have to be eliminated entirely, but the massive need that we think we have for more and more things is totally false. There is nothing wrong with getting enjoyment from obtaining an item, but the amount of value that we have put on this is far too extreme. If we could focus on enjoying experiences and interactions with other people more, we would find more happiness in life overall.

In conclusion, modern society is too materialistic. We value things more than people. We compare ourselves with others based on what we have instead of who we are. If we could reset ourselves and focus on meaningful interactions with each other, rather than the grandest, biggest, and shiniest new thing that week, we would achieve real long lasting happiness. We could spend so much more time on being with each other, and working for the good off all people and our planet, if we did not spend so much time working on mankind and acquiring the latest and greatest.

But now that I have a family, I feel even happier, and most of that comes from the deep-seated satisfaction of helping my kids become good people and thrive in life. The excitement and joy on my oldest kid's face when he recently got his driver's license is something I will remember forever. Watching my youngest kid's face light up when I took him on his first carnival ride was magical. It's these little moments where I have provided my kids with a new experience or the tools for success toward a goal that bring me pure happiness.
Happiness can mean different things to different people and can come from different soures. But for me, I have found that true happiness comes not from my individual pursuits but from helping bring happiness to others.

345,MATERIALISM,"Should modern society be criticized for being materialistic?

Some people in today's world say that our society is too materialistic.For most people, the acquiring of money and possesions is a basic necessity for survival and for many.the pursuit of material things can given a certain purpose to their life.So materialism becomes a basic fact of life as we, as physical beings, exist in a physical world.

So the question posed here deals with subtle point.Materislism is necessary because of the nature of the world we inhabit.""Should our modern society be criticized for being materialistic?""does not get to the real issue.Of course,individuals are free to criticize whatever they want,at least ideally,that is the case in our society.The real question is being asked here,or I think should be asked, is rather""Does our modern society put too much emphasis on materialism and materialistic pursuits?""

If one were to follow through with that line of thinking,the deeper premise of the question posed becomes apparent-does putting too much stress on materialism pursuits come at cost and is that cost too high?

In my opinion,it all boils down to individual choice.Many have found a purpose in life beyond the mere pursuit of physical possesions, realistically translated to acquiring money in our society, and use their time time on this planet for other purposes-Humanitarian or artistic, or even self-indulgence,as thrill seeking or global travel-and use the pursuit of the material as a means to an end,beyond mere dat to day physical survival.

Materialism is a fact of life life in a physical world,but it does not have to be its sole purpose.An individual must decide on his or her life path and adjust the level of material concern accordingly . Society can only dicate so much-even though commercialism,which is rampant in our society,has other ideas-i.e.,forcasting consumerism.However,that is a matter for another essay.

I think it's those who aim to help others, for the following reasons:
When you aim to help others, you also improve yourself. You make sure that the skills you have are competent enough to teach others. You put in extra work. You finish your duties first,and allow yorself extra time to help that collegue with their overflow. You study a little bit more than required to make sure your understanding is top notch before you meet with yor study  partner. Yor don't want to let them down, so in turn, you dont't let yorself down. You strive not only to achieve for yorself, but for others. There  is accountability. And, there is cooperation.

There is no risk of failure, only the cost of ever-refreshing time. There  is no deadline to learning and to helping. The methods can constantly be revised, improved upon, compound upon each  other.
 Winning is defined very narrowly. Be the best. Beat everyone else. Top score, first place, or else. Helping others is more broad. It's easier to achieve small steps to work up to an ultimate goal.

Historically, cooperation has always been s driving factor in every society,civilizion.empire ect. It's what has allowed humen beings to advance technologically in the time and produce better tools,better cars, better factories etc. No human being is able to creat an Iphone by himself. One needs the full cooperation of a team.Every invention needs to be viewed ,assessed.fixed.review re assessed and then finally bublished.Almost no invention ever comes out perfectley the first time.That's why cooperation is a must in a work environment.Take a look at big corporation like Amazon,or Ikea for example.Milliions of workers globally work there to help keep shipments alive,and keep products moving.Some people have achived succecc by their own,but those are very few compares to the large scheme of things. cooperation comes with its negative too though.Quite some times,collaborating with someone for example for a project at work,or to sell a house in real estate,if you side with the wrong person with either the wrong intentions or just not capable to do the job, it could get you in legal trouble,could allow you to lose a lot of monet,lose ypur job etc.There is where I think competing against that person insted of collaborating with them is actually better, because some people will only try to get close to you and ""work with you"" just to take advantage of you or will only lower your skill or will take a commanding role where you would have thrived more.

Competition on the other hand , is one's drive to do better at something than someone else. I belive tht through that mindest, one can truly surpass his limits and improve in any department that person is putting his/her's time and effort in.I belive there are two sides of competition,A healthy side and an unhealthy side.Healthy compition as most might call,is when two parties are trying to achive somthimg in the best way possible ,reaching success and trying to beat whover is competing with yopu in that department.Unhealthy competition as a simple example,would be two gladiators fighting for a crowed to prove wh is stronges. Virtually ,nothing is really gained by this ,just like in sports i truly belive one team  bathind another team in basket ball or football or tennis has been able to become better is through competition.competition allows us to find a goal,while having someone trying to defact you or just di better than you in that goal. To me ,this what drives modt people todo better on life.

I like to consider myself a kind and generous person, and I'm loathe to consider anything selfish, so initially the idea of focusing on personal happiness repulsed me. I've spent a great portion of my own life taking care of other people, going above and beyond, putting in extra effort even when I knew the end result was negligible to myself and might possibly only result in a smile from someone else. Today I write not from a place of resentment or any kind of disappoinment but out of an honest bweilderment and maybe just a little bit of fatigue. Not fatigue at having helpe, but more at the realization that my bag of tools needs to be refreshed. I don't think I've done everything I could to help others, far from it, I think that I've come to a point in my life where the help I can offer to others is narrowing and maybe what I need is to take a break and refocus on the things that I can change about myself. Things I can learn in order to help others and to help myself. Because really I think the problems is just that I don't feel as relevant anymore. I think most people at the very least need that base level of existence to their lives. As we age we kind of lose that relevance. I don't believe we have to though, because anyone can learn anything new and if you have the time and opportunity then you should take it.

These are the people who make society worse.  As long as they get their benefits they don't care what happens to others.  Politicians who want donations and say whatever will get them votes.  Fossil fuel moguls who will damage the environment for a quick buck.  Managers who will pay their employees starvation wages to pocket some more money.  People who only look out for themselves are the source of most problems in the world. If more people had sympathy and tried to make a positive impact, we would be much happier as a species.  

Overall, it is important to focus on your own goals. However, make sure to not get blinded by greed and only living for yourself.  Being kind and focusing on making others happy should always be a goal in one's life. ",4,0.949089404

How do we know that what we're investing our time, effort, money into is worth it? I believe that more often that not people are investing their energy into things that aren't what they appear to be. We idolize celebrities and how they look, act and live their lives. We spend our money on clothing that will be out of style in a matter of months, try the newest diet, and endlessly consume without taking a look at what we're consuming.

People have lost touch with what's important in life. It seems to me that many people have gotten swept up in the capitalistic world that we live in. They care too much about what others think of them, how they're percieved. I don't think they're to blame for that though. I believe greed and capitalism have gotten the best of us--we're constantly being sold things at every turn. We're constantly shown the ""ideal"" and made to feel that we need to constantly be striving towards that. But what we're not told is that ""ideal"" is not tanglible. Nobody can be perfect.

It's difficult to tell if this problem is getting worse or better. Growing up in the 90s/early 2000's I remember the scandal that was Jessica Simpson being grossly overweight. Looking back now there's no way she weighed more than 130lbs. But beauty standards have become mmore rigid in other areas so it's hard to determine if we've gone forward in this aspect or not. Plastic surgery is becomming commonplace and more and more stock is placed into how we look.

Ultimately I believe this obsession with impressions and how we are percieved by others is driven by consumerism. We're being sold this version of reality--this shiny,perfect thing--that doesn't really exist. And until we fundamentally change the way our world works it will remain this way, it can't change until we start focusing on ourselves and not those around us.

353,HAPPINESS,"Have you ever wondered what most people think makes them the most happy? Is it when they focus and accomplish their own goals? Or maybe it's when they focus on the happiness of others. This argument has been going on for quite some time, and everyone has their own opinion on it. On one side of things, one can become happy because of that feeling when they accomplish a goal. That feeling of satisfaction. On the other hand, making someone else happy can definitely make yourself feel good about yourself, knowing that you can change someones life. You never know what someone is going through. I firmly believe that the key to someones happiness is more leaning towards focusing on other peoples happiness, rather than focusingon their own personal goals.

Both of these will lead to happiness. However, I think it is more important to put other people first. For me, when I make someone else happy, it makes me feel better instantly on the spot. Sometimes I'll think about it for a bit, knowing their face and how glad they were that someone else cared. You never know what someone is going through, and you could make a huge difference for them. For example, helping the homeless. There is no dobut that this has been a problem for a long time, but actually helping someone (giving them food, water, not even just money), gives you a feeling of contentment. On the other hand of things, people may argue that focusing on their own personal goals makes them happy. Yes, that is definitely the case as well. SSomeone can work towards their goal for years, and finally be happy that they reached it. But then what? You make another goal, and work towards that. When you focus on someone making someone else's day and focus on them, you can help them feel happy and maybe even help yourself. Factors such as self-esteem and friends can have a huge impact on your happiness. You should definitely make goals, but what if you made those goals on helping someone else be happy? You'll be reaching a goal and focusing on someone else. For example, a personal goal could lead to getting a job or obtaining a certain amount of money. That's amazing that you reached that goal, but sometimes things happen. Your money can run out, you can lose your job. Friends on the other hand are not so easy to lose. As long as you focus on their happiness more than not, if they're a true friend they will stick with you forever and help you find happiness too. I'm also not saying that you should never focus on yourself. Too much of not focusing on yourself could eventually show bad side effects, so it's important to limit that focus of other people. But don't be selfish to the point that you never help anybody or their happiness.

In conclusion, I believe that focusing on someone else's happiness is what makes a human more likely to be happy. A personal goal is super valuable to set for yourself and you should do that, but also focusing and giving to those who might be let down will make you feel even better inside. Peoplewill stick with you more than money will. People might say that it is important to focus on yourself so you could better yourself, and in some circumstances, this is correct.

354,HAPPINESS,"Happiness can come from a multitude of sources, but what is the most likely cause of one's happiness? Is it focusing on your own personal agenda, such as goals, likes, dislikes, wants or needs, or could it be casting your own personal goals and agenda aside and focusing on the happiness of others? To answer this, one must analyze the idea of happiness, what it may entail, and whether it is strictly one or the other. I believe that happiness is more likely to come to those who put the gratification of others before themselves. Once this occurs, happiness will come to them naturally. The old saying goes, ""misery loves company"", and I believe happiness to have the same effect. If those around you are joyful, your measure of your own personal cheer will likely increase. To create joy for others is to outwardly spread your own happiness.

In society, those who tend to focus on themselves in order to be happy tend to alienate those around them. While being laser-focused on their own well-being, they neglect to take into consideration the feeling of the people closest to them. As this occurs, they are in fact spreading discord, which can then seep back into their life by the outward expression of other's disapproval, thus affecting the happines they are attempting to build by focusing on their own goals. One could also argue that you must first be content with yourself in order to bring delight to others. While this may seem true on the surface, how can anyone be satisfied with themselves surrounded by troubled people and with no intention of remediating the gloom? The answer is, you can't if you are looking for true contentment. One must cast away selfishness and think more of society as a whole.

Arguments could be made that happiness is subjective, just as they say ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"". One reason for one person's happiness could be a reason for disdain in another. This idea soldifies the thought that fixating on others' contentment could bring a new light to what makes you happy internally. For one to truly be happy, the focus must be outward in order to allow the natural internal bliss to occur. Doing good for others and society, bringing happiness to those around you while removing the focus from yourself is the key to being happy. External gratification creates internal satisfaction.

355,COMPETITION,"Competition versus cooperation -which is more successful in achieving goals? While cooperation requires that several people work towards a common goal to be accomplished togther, as a team, competition is similar, but quite the opposite. Competition is several people working towards a common goal as well;however, each person is working individually to do it faster and/or better than the next person.

Success may be achieved either way. Unfortunately, competition can do drive people to do things they wouldn't normally do such as sabatoging an opponent or cheating to win. Coincidentally, cooperatiom is likely to bring forth a sense of teamwork and belonging, which will bring more success in the long run. When everyone is out for themselves vying for the top spot or prize, they are focused on one thing-winning. They often don't care what they have to do to win. In a cooperative environment when everyone is working as a team to obtain the same goal, they are only helping each other.  Things are not usually done in haste when everyine is cooperating as opposed to when they are competing.

Many people have the opinion that competition is a much better way to achieve success than cooperation is. They say that it is a much more motivating factor. While it may be true that competition is the better motivational tool when it comes to certain individuals, it is much more beneficial in the long run for people to feel like they are part of a team and working together. For example, a woman named Lydia was in a competition at her work for weight loss. Lydia was extremely motivated to win the prize of $100 if she lost the most weight. She would bring in cookies and other unhealthy snacks for her coworkers to try to sabatoge their diets.She did not feel good about doing this,but she wanted to win. She ended up winning the money only to turn around and spend it on food and gained the weight she'd lost back within weeks. The next year she suggested that instead of a competition, the workplace hold a weightloss program which entails everyone working together to lose the weight and then for every pound lost, a dollar is donated to a certain charity. Lydia lost even more weight than she did the first time! All of the employees worked together, gave each other tips, and brought in healthy snacks to share.  They even started walking together after work. They ended up raising almost $200, the employer decided to match it, and they were able to donate nearly $400 to their charity! They all felt great and realized what the power of teamwork can do. 

All in all, cooperation can definitely bring about more success than competition. Working together is the way to go in almost any situation. So much more can be achieved when you are working with someone instead of against them, especially when success can feel so much better when you didn't do anything negative or morally wrong to achieve it.

357,MATERIALISM,"Materialsim is a big aspect in our lives, more than we take time to consider. Everything we have ever owned outside of neccessities fits in this category. The constant drive to continue to get more things fuels our drive to work to be able to afford more things. These things we acquire are directly tied to our happiness, so the process of working hard and spending our earnings on things we enjoy continues throughout our life. A responsbile approach to materialism can actually be a very good thing, and add a sense of meaning to our lives.

Modern society may be becoming too materialistic, but this doesn't come without positives. When people decide to spend, this creates jobs. Someone has to be there to pick, pack and ship an order out to someone buying something new for themselves. As for the person doing the purchasing, they are doing something that is contributing to their happiness, which improves their quality of life. Is that something we would really want to take away?

Allowing people to purchase the things that make them happy keeps people as productive members of society, and leads to a better economy. Depression rates could fall as a result of the increased happiness related to materialism. However, having access to materialism and losing access to your buying power could lead to problems in itself. As long as responsibility plays a factor in how someone is acquiring their possessions, it should not be a cause for concern. No one should be going into debt to acquire material items, especially temporary items you won't have for an extended period of time.

In conclusion, I do not think we should criticize modern society for being too materialistic. I believe certain individuals are more materialistic than others, and if they are willing to carry the risks of potentially having to downgrade their quality of life down the road, that is their choice to make.

I donate to toy drives, donate clothes, volunteer with the Girl Scouts, etc. It always makes me happy to see that I have made a difference in a child's life. There is truly no greater feeling than seeing a child open a present from ""Santa"" at a school Christmas party and knowing that you made that smile appear on the child's face. It's the most heartwarming feeling I have ever felt.

Another point would be that good deeds are contagious. If you help somebody, it makes them feel good. This would encourage them to then help somebody else and so on down the line. I believe if we all just make an effort to do atleast one good deed every day, then this would be a much happier place

Although there are certain people who seem to thrive off of competition, many others would rather avoid it altogether. I personally like cooperating with others and feel more motivated to reach a goal when I am on the same page as everyone else. It brings a real sense of unity to a group that is trying to achieve the same goal instead of thinking of ways to upstage or put down someone else's ideas like you would in a competitive settin.

Competition also put me on edge and makes me quite paranoid. I feel like I cannot trust anyone and someone is always out to get me. It does not motivate me to work harder to achieve success, rather it makes me feel less sure of my abilities. Competition can bring out the worse aspects of one's personality, especially if they feel they have to make themselves look better than another person. We do not have to cut down others to make ourselves more succefful. I believe that leads to hurt feelings for the person who did not reach the goals as well as feelings of inadequacy.

This question is like what came first the chicken or the egg because I think that cooperation plays a developmental role in learning skills that lead to success and likewise competition also plays a role in success in providing the impetus to continue through the ultimate trials and errors to find the successful strategies and paths to achieve success. But, Ifeel that competition is the most important driving force in success even if it is against ones self because cooperation is a step along the way and helps to hone skills and shape one's values to learn along with another person with similar goals and skill levels and ultimately helps one to desire the success that they want to experience in the competition setting.

The reason I believe that competition challenges one to success because it is competition that helps to develop that drive to succeed especially against others with similar or greater skills.The most intense competition can actually be against one's self to achieve greater and increasingly greater successes than were exhibited prior to the next one. Having a rival and opponent is stimulation and cap push one to persevere and act with more drive and determination.

We can see clearly the power of competition on the spots field. Competitors spur one another onward to their respective goals and it can bring out strong emotions and feelings of competitvenes that drive the participants to work harder and ever increasing with more zeal and fortitude to gain the goal.

I know that those who are in favor cooperation have valid points for that argument but cooperation can be rather flimsy and wavering in the areas of drive and determination to achieve success and while great strides can be made and success is within reach and can be achieved often, the emotinal elements that competition demands is missing and the elements of acting with a drive to push onward sometimes past comfort levels just isn't the same.

I also thought about my own life and how i achieved some of my life's successes. Iexperienced successes working in cooperation with others but I didn't apply myself to work hard and put myself in a position of acting with a consistency and drive toward the goals. I would be satisfied to stay within the status quo and not put myself out of my comfort zone to achieve more than was expected. I really did better when a peer was observable and I put up my skills against theirs and I had a better work ethic and powered through even when I was tired or uncomfortable in an effort to do my ultimate best to better that competitor.

I am sticking to my opinion that yes, people do achieve more success by competition than by cooperation.

In conclusion, images and advertisements definitely have a large effect on people. They force people to have the opinion that they want portrayed without allowing them to have all sides of the story and form their own opinion which may differ from what the advertisement is hoping for.

Cooperation allows for a greater means to reach success as it fosters positive relationships, and a more positive working environment while competition can breed hostile work environments that ultimately do not produce successful results.

Intense competition can have the opposite impact on productivity. Fostering an environment of constant rivelry can create animosity between coworkers in which less is produced overall. Additionally, animosity between coworkers creates a negative working space in which individuals may began despising what they do regularly. The goal should be to create an environment where individuals get along with one another. thus these relationships can foster growth.

However, it may be true limited competition can be a good motivator. You do not want individuals to be complacent where they are. Complacency does not breed growth nor is productive. So small amounts of  competition can help stimulate a workplace when things are at a standstill. Again this cannot be taken too far where the competition leads to hostility amongst coworkers when pitted against one another.

All in all, cooperation and competition have a place in achieving success. However, cooperation can hace a stronger pull in success when pitted against competition. Cooperation helps build strong relationships in which you can go to your resources for assistance to meet an end product. Competition can cause unnecessary rivalry between individuals that can limit success.

369,MATERIALISM,"What  is the purpose of working and earning money, if not to buy things? I believe that modern society should not be criticized for being materialistic. I think that throughout history, our society has grown to value things and what they can do for us. There is a certain point where things can bring happiness, similar to experiences, love, and the like.

People buy things for a reason. There is truth behind the 'shoppers high' that people get. Knowing that you can afford and buy things bring happiness in itself. The ease at which people can purchase things has also led to our society growing in materialistic tendenecies. Throughout history, society has grown more and more materialistic and that has boosted our economy and made everyone generally more well off. Back in the day, it started off as buying or acquiring or trading for what you needed and no more. Then it turned to what you actually wanted, whether it be a certain type of food or clothes. Eventually it led to getting what makes you happy. The ultimate source of it is happiness and pleasure. If buying a 4Ooz steak makes you happy, do it. If buying clothes from goodwill makes you happy, go for it! If buying designer dress that you will only wear once makes you happy, go for it! This isn't to say you should buy things just because they make you happy in that moment without thinking, though.I am a full beleiver in evaluating why you want an item and then making the decision. If the decision is till that you want it, I don't see why it should be criticized at all. If you end up not wanting it or needing it in  the future, you can donate it. If it continues to bring you happiness and joy, keep it! We shouldn't all live like  we are still in the great depression - those were different times.

Additionally, being materialsitic is entirely an individual choice. If you want to buy items, you do it. Noone forces you to spend your money on things you don't want. If you are doing that, that could symbolize some mental issues of trying to fit in with people who aren't like you, jealousy, or other negative traits.

The only opposition to this is buying things you can't afford, but that would be an entirely different topic on budgeting and jealousy that is not playing into my opinion. Being materialistic does  not equate being a bad person, though some may try to amke that claim. If you can buy something that brings you happiness, do it - the world needs more happy people.","What is the purpose of working and earning money, if not to buy things?

Perhaps it is different for each of us. It might not be fair to pinpoint it as one specific thing. It can probably come from many different sources. For those that look for it, and never seem to find it though, they are given tons of advice from others as where to find it. They are told to follow thier dreams and accomplish their goals, yet this doesn't always work for people. Others are told that helping others and taking your focus away from self will lead you down the path. But is that always true for everyone?

If there was such an easy remedy, there there would probably not be the need for so many different medications for mental health and poeple would probably not be dealing with so much anxiety and self-medicating. The truth is, there is probably not one answer for this for any person. The answer probably changes constantly through a person's life as well. This week, focusing on their own goals might bring them happiness, however next week it might bring greater joy to them if they focus on others.

Another issue is we place such an emphasis on being happy all the time. It is okay to have moments in life that are not going so well. With social media and scrutiny from everyone else in general, we are under pressure at all time to appear to have perfect lives. The truth is, we all have times that are low and not fun. We all have dips in our life where happiness is just not an option. That is okay. We need to accept that reality and realize that these times will pass. There are more emotions to life then being happy or sad.

Back to the idea of happiness. I do feel that if you take the focus off of yourself, you do tend to experience more joy. Helping others and seeing them accomplish can do more for your soul then just about anything else. That can keep you happy in the long-term.

There will always be other goals that you feel you need to accomplish as a result - feel happy.

372,MATERIALISM,"Materialism is an ever- growing and developing aspect of modern society. It has a large impact on how people live their lives and how a large amount of their time is spent. Materialism in modern society should certainly be condemned because the feelings created by behaving in a materialistic way (e.g. feeling that you're better off) are the opposite of what materialism actually does to the lives of individuals.

The main driver behind materialistic behavior is the intrinsic reward that is given by the behavior. When an individual buys something that seems to be ""owned by everybody elso already,"" they are rewarded with the feeling that they are just as good, or even better, than other people. This feeling is usually externalized as having more money or resources than other individuals. By displaying that one has more money/resources than other, one receives the feeling that they have accomplished more, or have achieved the ideals of society to a greater extent that these others they are comparing themselves with. It is completely natural for individuals to desire resources in their lives, as basic resources are necessary for human survival. Materialism, though, is not focused on acquring basic resources that are necessary for survival.

If an individual were to only desire resources that were necessary for survival, they would generally come to a point of equilibrium where they would only expend as much effort as necessary to get the exact amount of resources needed for their own survival. With gathering resources necessary for survival there is an internal feedback mechanism that lets an individual (or group) know that they have acquired what is necessary, or what is ""enough.""

Materialism intentionally externalizes this feedback mechanism so that whethter wht an individual (or group) has is ""enough"" or not becomes dependent on what another individual or group has. If materialism only worked this way, as a single group comparing itself and its resources to another group, it would not have nearly the negative effect that it does on individuals. Unfortuately, materialism creates a cycle of judgment, with both individuals constantly judging the level of their own resources based on the resources of the other individual. This cyclical judgment leads to an ""arms race"" of sorts, with each individual always trying to acquire more that the other simply for the fact of having more.

The societal adoption of materialism also causes individuals to judge the value of other individuals based on their level of possession of materialistic resources. So, since materialism then creates the acceptance of judging the value of an individual based on what material goods they possess, it can begin to cause individuals to value the pursuit of materialistic resources over resources that are necessary for their survival. In this way, individuals who started acquiring materialistic resources to show how well off they were in terms of resources and access to resources, end up with nothing value as different materialistic resources become more desirable than the materialistic resources they currently possess. In this way, by pursuing the immediate reward of feeling "" as good off or better than others,"" individuals end up being depleted of their resources, as well as their ability to use these resources in more meaningful ways than pursuing materialistic possessions that almost immediately lose their value.","Materialism is an ever-growing and developing aspect of modern society.

373,COMPETITION,"When it comes to competition, some may say it's what drives them to be the best version of themselves. Competition drives sports, sales, and salaries. What people fail to think of is the team behind them that cooperates in these actions to help you achieve the best possible outcome. I propose that competition is nothing without cooperation.

It's Monday night and football is on. Take sports as a prime example of what drives the best overall achievement; it's team efforts that win the game. Every single person has a drive in them to compete, it's how they ended up in the NFL. However, what makes the teams stick out above the rest? It's cooperation. One single play can't consistently achieve greatness game after game, without cooperation from his coaches, teammates, & everyone along the way.

The quarterback can't rely on his talents and competitive drive to be the best. You need your offensive line to protect you long enough to throw the ball out. You need your wide receiver to catch it. You need your kicker to make the extra point attempt. You  need cooperation behind each and every force to guide you along the way. It takes a team, a cooperation by all.

Competition in sales for examples drives your salary. One can argue that to be in sales, you have to embody a competitive drive. However, that isn't the case. You can have the competitive drive to go out day after day, long hours after long hours, to increase your sales. But you alone aren't sealing those sales. Your boss, your coworkers, your leads, the team collective effort that is behind you helps you achieve and close those deals. 

Personally, at work, we have a competition to who can save the most money at the company. This drives competition, sure. However, my coworkers and those on my team continuously provide ideas and next steps for one another on how to help everyone. It's cooperation that has brought out the best ideas and results on our crew. If we all held onto our own ideas and beliefs, we would have missed out on hundreds of thousands of dollars to help our company save.

374,HAPPINESS,"While some people say that happiness comes from within, I believe that true happiness comes from a combination of making yourself and others happy. To begin with, it is important to take steps to become happy with yourself - simply making others happy will not allow one to achieve true overall happiness.

To begin with, you have to look at what makes yourslf happy. For me, good health is probably the most important thing. To achieve this my wife and I do crossfit workouts every moring, followed by a 2-mile walk. In addition to that I regularly ride my bike from our home to the post office to drop off packages for my home mail order business. We also enjoy many other active outdoor pursuits, such as hiking, bicycling and long distance backpacking. We recently hiked over 700 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail - in the pocess I lost 32 pounds and have nerver felt better. 

In addition to good health, I also have several hobbies that make me happy. I'm an avid music fan, with a large collection of music that I list to. It is also beneficial to my happiness that my main income source is running a music record label and web-based music shop. I also enjoy reading and gardening - both of which are relaxing and let my mind rest for a while.

In my opinion another key to happiness, which helps oneself as well as others, is simplify your life. This can done in the home by reducing spending on things you don't need, reducing clutter and the amount of ""stuff""that you have, and not spending as much money on going out to restaurants. What this achieves is more money in the bank, which reduces stress and increases happiness. It also reduces one's enviornmental impact - each person is consuming less and using less resources. If everyone reduced consumption by just a little, the overall impact on the planet can potentially be enormous.

On the flip side, focusing soplely on oneself isn't the path to overall happiness - it's also important to help others. For me I try to help others in several ways. With my music business I donate 10% of proceeds to organizations that help people of color get into the outdoors, women's groups, and environmental causes and non - profits that plant trees all over the world. My wife and I have also volunteered with All Hands & Hearts, a disaster releif program that helps rebuild homes and schools after hurricanes, fires and flodds have occured. Finally, I devote a good amount of time to the Washigton Trails Association, which does trail building and maintainence throughout the state of Washington.

In summary, the things I do for myself work hand-in-hand with the thins that I do for others to help achieve overall happiness.

376,COMPETITION,"There's the old proverb: if you want to go fast. go alone, but if you want to go far, go together. Yet Western cultures are not filled with communal victories in the stories we tell. Our history books are full of the names of great men, with short shrift given to the support behind them. so why do we emphaize individual greatness at the expense of historic accuracy? Is this the better way to view history-- as great men against a background of support staff best left in the background?

There's another old proverb: no man is an island. we can develop a variety of skills, but one human lifetime only grants the space to be master of a handful at most. The vast majority of us are blessed to master one skill over a lifetime. But grand accomplisments, the kind that tend to make history books, require master level work of multiple skills. The Pyramids of Giza required not just an architect, but highly skilled masons, construction crews, and artisans in multiple media. They are an Egyptian accomplishment because they required so much Egyptian skill and effort to create.

Even when a single master is credited, they are often the head of a team and not the sole talent involved. Beyonce is  a masterful vocal artist, dancer, and overall entertainer, but even if she were to perform alone, her work would show the guidance of coaches, composers, producers, choreographers, and the myriad influences she brings to her work, which can come from any art form.

In every sphere oh human achievement, cooperation builds brilliance. Even copmetition often takes place between teams, and a better organized team can best an individual or a poorly organized team. Tesla was not a worse scientist than Edison; he was a less sociable and less well-connected one. We advise those beginning their careers that ""it's not what you know."" Schiaparelli's fashion ideas may have been fanciful, but it was the business team behind Chanel that made her name a lasting influence in fashion. Competition helps us hone our skill-- including our team building and team leading skills, which can often beat technical proficiency.

We are not a species designed to live or work alone. Babies are born helpless to people who are weakened by hours of labor. we succeeded as a species by banding together and assigning some of us to hunt and others to gather. Some groups got better places to hunt or gather by beating other groups, but no lone gatherer has managed to exclude a group from that lone person's tuber-gathering ground. And whether we're gathering tubers or building skyscrapers, we need each other.

377,COMPETITION,"
Competition or cooperation? That is the question.
Personally, I've always found that cooperation yields better results than competition, but there are of course
other schools of thought.

Most people assume that the world today was built by 
competition. I argue that it was built by cooperation. If
the rulers cannot get their subjects to cooperate,
nothing will get done. Occasionally the majority has
used whatever means necessary to gain cooperation
from the minority, including violence, but the end goal
is always to get them to adhere to the program those in
power have laid out.

When competition is introduced, it quickly becomes a
wasteful process. What happens to the losers progress?
It's washed down the drain in favor of whomever won
the competition and forgotten. The losers will inevitably
feel that their effort was for nothing, and may choose
not to participate any further. However, if everyone
involved cooperated on the same project, all progress is
saved and even if discarded in the future can be used as
lessons for future projects. With competition, the
opposite occurs. All efforts and material from those
who lost is gone, and all lessons from the losers is lost.

I would also argue, that it is competition that has left
the world in the state that it is in today. With the
voracious consumption of resources in order to out do
the competition, we are quickly stripping away our
finite resources with very little to show once complete.
We have come to a point as a society that winning at all
cost is celebrated, and even the implication of losing is
seen as a failing.

There are of course times when healthy competition
springs forth innovations, but these are usually
mistaken as benefitial when they are in fact
detrimental. Take for example the race between the
USSR and the USA to get to the moon. Many have
argued that without this competition, nobody would
have done it. This is just plain wrong. Countless
resources were expended on both sides for the exact
same goal. If the two countries had cooperated and
shared their knowledge and resources, we could have
seen the it as a globally unifying event, rather than
""America rules"" moment. Sure, everybody gets that
fleeting hit of dopamine, but what is really gained? We
could have a bustling space industry now if we weren't
so obsessed with competition.

When I was a kid, I wanted to go to space so badly. I
wanted it more than anything. That goal seemed
obtainable when I was young, now I know that I will
never be able to accomplish that goal. If I happened to
excel in literally any other area in life, I might have
enough money to make it possible, but unfortunately
my stance on cooperation rather than competition left
me vulnerable to the win at all costs crowd who will
take an easy win any day.

Let's take a look at business. The constant adversarial
stance taken by literally everyone involved in the
business world believe in the dog eat dog mentality.
Never do they suspect that they are making the world a
hostile place that no sane person would want to live in.
Who wants to even try when you know that any effort
on your part will be thwarted by some faceless
corporation with deep pockets attempting to build an
empire for shareholders benefit. This is how dreams
die.

We need a new system.

380,HAPPINESS,"In life, there are two types of people. There are the people who focus on themselves and the people who focus on others. The people who focus on themselves work to achieve their own goals and happiness, ignoring what others say; while the people who focus on others put themselves last and put those around them first to ensure their happiness. They listen others and ignore themselves. In this essay, I will prove that those who choose to put themselves first and focus on themselves, are more likely to be happy.

Firstly, when you put yourself first, you know your goals and what makes you happy. When you put others before you, you are doing what makes them happy, and as such you are putting your personal feelings and goals last. By putting yourself first, the only thing you need to figure out is how you are going to meet your goal and make yourself happy. Only you know what makes you happy. Your parents, siblings, teachers or bosses have no idea. The only thing they know about you is what you choose to show the world. Only you know the real you. 

Secondly, when a person does the research to figure out what they need to do to achieve their goals, they are driven to achieve those goals. While working towards their goal, they are working for themselves and no one else. If they fail to achieve their goal, the have the satisfaction of being able to say they worked hard and they did it. Whether its a small goal like buying a new outfit, or a larger goal like getting a higher paying job, the person who focuses on them can say with pride that they accomplished their goal and worked towards their own happiness. Those who work towards others happiness cannot say that. 

Critics of this may say that putting the focus on others can make you happy as well. While this may be the case, people who actively put themselves last and put others before themselves are not in a position to reach their own goals or make themselves happy as they are not focusing on themselves. They may be in a situation where they are unable to put themselves first, such as being a family caregiver for example, where the caregivers wants and needs are always placed last while the person being cared for is always first, and while it may make the caregiver happy to see the person that they are caring for happy, is it really true happiness that caregiver feels or is it job satisfaction?

Additionally, putting the focus on others is actually a trauma response from unresolved trauma received through childhood wherein a person they were close to, either a parent or a sibling, them them behind for whatever reason. The person who was left behind (may) feel as though if they do not focus on others happiness, that the person will leave them and as such they may feel compelled to focus on others to keep them from leaving and as such they choose to put other people above themselves instead of focusing on themselves. 

While happiness is felt in many different ways through many different things, it can be assumed that those who focus on themselves are more likely to be happy than those who do not focus on themselves as they know themselves best and just need to research and figure out what to do to realize their dreams and make themselves happy. Happiness varies from person to person, and what makes Jack happy may not make Jane happy, and vice versa.

Though in our society we often believe that the pursuit of happiness involves focusing on our own desires, this is counter-productive.

Many people who have dedicated their lives to the pursuit of pleasure become so depressed that they turn to substances for comfort or even take their own lives. On the other hand, pro-social behavior promotes happiness as well as social cohesion. People are happiest when they have strong social bonds in their lives. While it is important to focus on self-care at times, it is also important to remember that caring for others is crucial to our own well-being.

Given the evidence, it is clear that if we want to be happy, we should look first to ensuring the happiness of those around us. It is a lesson that we would all be wise to keep in mind. If we fail to give happiness to others, we may find that we hav enone left for ourselves at the end of the day.",4.5,0.993908154
382,HAPPINESS,"If the experience of happiness is a facet of a life well-lived, what will make a person happy? Is working to benefit oneself the way to proceed, or is helping others the route to happiness? In this essay I will ponder these two questions.

A person might have one or more significant goals in life. These goals might include earning lots of money, having a satisfying career, having a family, pursuing hobbies and interests, and constantly learning, among other things. In addition to loving and being loved, a person needs to work. Any of the goals I mentioned above requires a significant amount of work to attain. Not only the accomplishment of a goal can produce happiness. The work that is involved in pursuing a goal might be enjoyable as well. Work can be difficult, but even difficult work can bring a person a sense of peace while the person is doing it. In some cases, when working, there is less time to worry about the future, and not worrying about the future is an important component of happiness.

Some might argue that pursuing one's own goals is selfish, that we are obligated to help others without concern for our own interests or even for our own well-being.

Human beings need connection with other human beings, and there is something innately psychologically satisfying about knowing that one has helped others. Therefore, in some cases helping others may lead to happiness.

A relatively small number of people (such as Objectivists) may claim that helping others and not oneself is evil, that altruism is evil. For them, being moral requires pursuing one's own happiness ( in an ehical way).

Perhaps it is possible to combine the two approaches (working for one's own happiness and helping others) by trying to achieve happiness BY helping others. That may seem selfish, but it benefits everyone.

It is also possible that trying to be happy by helping oneself benefits others. For example, in an economy that is relatively free, the pursuit of profit (done properly) requires one to create things of value to exchange with others. If the produces or seller is ehical, such an exchange benefits both the seller and the buyer. Objectivists oppose what they call altruism and advocate capitalism, but capitalism if done properly may be both selfish and altruistic.

In conclusion, there may be different ways to achieve happines. One might work toward one's own goals, or one might help others. Sometimes it is possible to do both at the same time.","If the experience of happiness is a facet of a life well-lived, what will make a person happy?

383,MATERIALISM,"From the first of a stick for a rock, the human race has engaged in commerce in some shape or form. Whether it be utilizing a barter system or a more regulated currency format, people have always wanted 'stuff'. At the heart of an argument over materialism lies the question of, is it wrong to want more than one should need? The answer to this question is that yes, today's society is quite over-materialistic and should be called on the carpet as such. I also want to note that this is not a global issue to the best of my knowledge, and to that extent we will focus on the American society.

An overused but accurate argument about materialism is the inequality of the rich vs. the poor. There are numbers of anecdotal stories about those who part with their wealth just to try and improve the lives of others less fortunate. Conversely, it is many a time that we hear of people who are so money and stuff-focused that they end up financially wealthy, but physically and socially lone.

Another criticism of materialism is that it shifts worth of anything to its extrinsic value of experience and acquisitions. In a sense, this is similar to chasing the addiction high of drugs, gambling, etc. in that the person acquiring is constantly trying to feel the way they once did in spending and buying their 'stuff'.

Arguments against criticizing materialism include private citizenship, politics/patriotism, and capitalism. First, proponents of materialism state that the private citizen should be allowed the privacy to acquire as they wish. However, the actions of a private citizen have public repercussons and are a part of the overall society.

Second, there are those who state that criticizing materialism is unpatriotic as part of the American way is excess. What this argument ignores is that this is not a core concept of American living; one could argue that the era of excess really did not begin until the advent of the credit card in the 1960s, and ballooned in the 1980s. The final argument is that capitalism is built on buying. This argument is somewhat flawed in that capitalism is built on the opportunity for free markets and personal choice, not simply the ability to buy everything.

In conclusion, the ability for  commerce, while creating explosive opportunity for societal growth, also created explosive opportunity for overuse.","From the first trade of a stick for a rock, the human race has engaged in commerce in some shape or form.

384,MATERIALISM,"Materialism is often synonymous with not being satisfied. There is always something new, something more improved, and our materialistic society dictates that in order to happy, we need to constantly buy new things. It often brings out competitve and manipulative behaviors in people, and it is absolutely encouraged by the fake lives people post to social media. I think we need to take a hard look at how materialism affects the people around us, and what it is doing to the planet. 

When a person is insecure, they tend to focus on outward displays of financial success. A person who is obsessed with having the shiniest sports car or the newest gaming console before anyone else may be indulging in a hobby, but they also may be worried about how they are perceived by the people around them to an unhealthy degree. Life is full of fancy things, but it isn't satisfying and does not bring them lasting happiness. In fact, materialism makes you more at risk for anxiety and depression, especially if your intent is to find happiness in inanimate objects. If you put material success above true happiness, you are less likely to actually achieve any lasting happiness. If you see no other way to validate your self worth other than to buy and buy and have outward displays of success, you can never be truly happy.

The phrase ""money is the root of all evil"" does not truly explain materialism. People who are poor will absolutely gain happiness if they are able to increase their income to the point of not living paycheck to paycheck. However, setting materialistic goals as someone whose financial situation is far from ideal may lead to lower levels of happiness. Often, materialistic goals have no endpoint. The goal of ""having more money"" may lead someone to become discouraged because the goalpost is always moving, and it encourages more and more materialism. The problem with money is that it brings happiness for a short time, but that happiness is fleeting, and leaves you craving more and more. Money is an addictive substance; you need more in order to get the same amount of pleasure you got from that first time. 

Materialism is not biological; it is a consequence of the consumerism we have normalized. We are bombarded with advertisements telling us we will look cooler, be adored, have an elevated status, or something else that would increase our quality of life. It is only from within that you can find true lasting happiness. It is also only from within that you can change how dependent and manipulated you are by the desire to buy more and more.

Competition can lead to ill will and bad feelings between people, because competition is a situation where one wins at the expense of another. One person wins a competition, and the best others can be is second best which is not good enough. Worse yet, someone will come in last place, and deal with the stigma that comes with that. In a competition, the rankings and outcome are public, which can make those who don't do well feel uncomfortable and inadequate. This can lead to low self esteem, and can be particularly difficult in situations where the people involved have to deal with each other on a regular basis, such as in a workplace or in a classroom.

On the other hand, cooperation is a joint, team effort, where everyone has the opportunity to contribute and be recognized. More goals can be achieved successfully through cooperation, especially now since the world is more polarized than ever. For example, the United States Congress is very polarized now, with almost an equal split between Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. IfDemocrats and Republicans would take the stance that half a loaf of bread is better than none, a lot more legislation could pass and become laws that could create progress for the entire American public. However, both parties are not willing to compromise enough to get things done.

In summary, cooperation can lead everyone, not just one, to feel that they got something they wanted, even if it is not everything. The winner take all idea behind competition leads to a large proportion of people not getting anything they wanted. Cooperation is inclusive and creates a situation where everyone can say they won at least something. It also builds good character with young people so they don't grow up to be selfish, spoiled brats that expect to have everything go their way. Cooperation is beneficial for society, out ability to get along with each other and accept and respect others for their differences, and for the greater public good.","People achieve more success by cooperating with others, rather than by competing with them.

386,HAPPINESS,"People are more happy when they focus on personal goals. Personal growth is measurable and most apparent to the individual acheiving it. Humans are inherently selfish. By being selfish one can become self sufficient and better off, freeing them up to have the capability of supporting others and being altruistic.

While it's true that altruism leads to happiness for spme, according to Mazlow's Hierarchy of needs, people need to fulfill multiple individual needs before they can reach self-actualization. Shelter/having a home, having enough food to feed oneself, and love are all significant needs that humans need to fulfill. If one cannot provide for themselves, how can they be expected to help others? For some, self-actualization consists of altruism and philanthropy. Examples of this include Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, MLK Jr, and Ghandi. Usually the process of self-actualization comes at later points in one's life, it's what gives meaning to ones's life, a higher objective/goal that people strive to achieve. This varies depending on people's statge of life, different household's while growing up, people's perspective, financial situation, etc. Regardless, pursuing one's personal goals gives one the fianacial/time freedom to help others and their happiness.

387,COMPETITION,"Do people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition?

Both cooperation and competition are vital elemenets in achievement. Most achievement involves both of those elements. For example, if a brilliant scientist conducts completely original research, he still depends on technicians to maintain his equipment, assistants to help him, etc.

On the other hand, those helperes would be unable to duplicate the scientist's intellectual feats. So I would argue that, in general, significant, lasting caccomplishements are more the product of individual efforts. These efforts often spring from a drive to excel, to do better than others, or to do better than oneself. Some may argue that cooperation is more liekly to produce great accomplishments. I would argue that even when cooperating, people are also competing against each other, or against the problem itself.

One could liken achievement to a good marriage. The husband is competing with other men for success and status. His wife is cooperating with him by supporting his efforts. If things go well, they will achieve worldly success and a happy family.

To summaraize the metaphor, the competitive drive of the husband is responsible for his success, but he couldn't achieve that success without his wife's support. Conversely, without the man's ambition, a supportive wife will be unable by herself to ensure the family's happiness and prosperity.

For many, it's the latter. For ome, it's the former. Should it be one or the other? Not necessarily. However, one is more successful at producing happy individuals than the other. Which is it, you ask? Let's dive a bit deeper into that. 

When someone does their job well and achieves their goals, what happens? They get congratulated and appreciated at work; maybe even get a raise! However, what follows that short window of happiness is another task, sometimes even more difficult that the original. After all, you completed your first task, so you are obviously ready for something more challenging. Suddenly, that happiness turns into stress and/or sadness. The same thing happens when you achieve your goals in life. YOu might be happy in the moment you achieve them, but what happens next? You suddenly feel directionless. With no goal to chase, what is the point of trying? And if your goal is never achievable, why put in the effort? Was accomplishing your goal really bringing you happiness, or did it just take away your sense of purpose?

Compare that to the happiness gained via others. If you make someone else happy, what comes next? That individual doesn't suddenly become unhappy, and you aren't suddenly unable to make others happy. You can continue to make others happy. You don't have to stay and make the same person happy over and over. Rather, you can go and make other people happy over and over.  There is no limit to making others happy, like there is to achieving a goal. And, typically, making others happy leads to others wanting to make you happy.

Happiness is contagious, and frankly, multiplicative. The more happy people that come together, the happier the atmosphere becomes. Choosing happiness via giving others happiness gives the most benefit as a whole, and honestly is the selfish of the two options. Achieving your goal benefits only yourself in most situations, whereas making someone else happy always benefits a minimum of two individuals: yourself and the person who is made happy. Given this information, it seems pretty clear that the happiness of others is going to give you the most happiness rather than achieving your goals. Bringing joy and happiness to others has no end in sight. Achieving goals does.

389,MATERIALISM,"There is a famous saying: ""Money can't buy happiness."" Many people complain about consumer culture and how materialistic our holidays have become, like the way that Christmas seems to be all about gifts rather than deeper meanings of either religion or family togetherness. It is a much vilified concept in today's society. The book and movie ""Fight Club"" against materialism in today's society, featuring a main character who began with so many things from so many catalogs. One could argue that participating in it ourselves.

It is often the wealthy who say a lot of these things, people who have all of the comforts they need in their lives, along with money to spare for luxury. People with plenty of material wealth often use this anti-materialistic notion in over to tell others less fortunate than themselves that they should be satisfied with what little they have, and they should not want more than that. Few of these people are giving much of their own wealth away, despite this criticism of consumerism. They tell how income people not to want more and to be grateful, without sharing or donating much of themselves. It is also inescapable. One cannot choose not to participate in the production and consumption of goods. Materials today are often designed to break down over time, forcing consumers to replace products the might once have been possible to repair. It is not free to survive in society.

It's true that holidays should be a celebration of loved ones, and perhaps one's religious beliefs if they have any. It's also true, from the perspective of the wealthy, that having a little bit more money or another gadget, is not likely to make them much happier. But a poor family getting their bit more happier. Buta poor family getting their first computer will find their world changed, having access to greater career and learning as well as social opportunities. There is nothing wrong with those who have little wealth wanting more. There is something wrong with people who have excess not being charitable. Karl Marx's Conflict Theory is considered materialistic, and is very critical of income inequality among workers. The people with the most money in society, who have the most material wealth, tend to do far less work than the people who live in poverty. Today's poor often work multiple jobs for small wages that often don't even meet the minimum wage, thanks to independent contracts and the gig economy. Ronald Reagan's myth of the welfare queen is also largely a myth, as it is not easy to qualify for government assistance, and anyone who has received it will be able to assure you, it is not enough to give them the luxurious life that Reagan led many conservatives to imagine. 

People who struggle with money, especially those below the poverty line, should not be shamed for wanting more. People with more should be more willing to donate and help other people in need. Unfortunately the ""American Dream"" is largely a myth. There are no billionaires who got to where they are without help, and without help, and without exploiting those beneath them. They take trips to space while people literally freeze to death without a roof over their heads. The wealthy make ice cream and hot dogs with gold flakes while there are children who go hungry because their only meals are free ones they get while attending school. There is valid criticism of materialism in our society, but we must direct this at the right people: the ultra rich. A person who finds themselves criticizing materialism today might consider taking a look at their own life, and determine if they really need and want everything they have, or if perhaps they can part with some of their own materials for the benefit of those who would be grateful to have them.","There is a famous saying: ""Money can't buy happiness.""

But a poor family getting their first computer will find their world changed, having access to greater career and learning as well as social opportunities. There is nothing wrong with those who have little wealth wanting more. There is something wrong with people who have excess not being charitable. Karl Marx's Conflict Theory is considered materialistic, and is very critical of income inequality among workers. The people with the most money in society, who have the most material wealth, tend to do far less work than the people who live in poverty. Today's poor often work multiple jobs for small wages that often don't even meet the minimum wage, thanks to independent contracts and the gig economy. Ronald Reagan's myth of the welfare queen is also largely a myth, as it is not easy to qualify for government assistance, and anyone who has received it will be able to assure you, it is not enough to give them the luxurious life that Reagan led many conservatives to imagine.

People who struggle with money, especially those below the poverty line, should not be shamed for wanting more. People with more should be more willing to donate and help other people in need. Unfortunately the ""American Dream"" is largely a myth. There are no billionaires who got to where they are without help, and without exploiting those beneath them. They take trips to space while people literally freeze to death without a roof over their heads. The wealthy make ice cream and hot dogs with gold flakes while there are children who go hungry because their only meals are free ones they get while attending school. There is valid criticism of materialism in our society, but we must direct this at the right people: the ultra rich. A person who finds themselves criticizing materialism today might consider taking a look at their own life, and determine if they really need and want everything they have, or if perhaps they can part with some of their own materials for the benefit of those who would be grateful to have them.",4.5,0.965508092

By achieving personal goals such as academic or career advancement for instance, an individual can improve their own circumstances, develop a healthy self esteem and improve their overall mental well being. For example, a person may have career aspirations of becoming a doctor. He or she may then work their way through education, get a residency, and then becomes a doctor. Once they become a doctor, their social and economic status will improve. They will find themself feeling more capable and confident. And perhaps most importantly, they can find a sense of purpose and meaning in their life.

Focusing only on ones personal goals and desires will never allow one to experience the full range of happiness that comes from bonding with others.

Volunteering or working to improve society is one way to make yourself happy. Though an action like working at a food bank may not have a direct personal benefit it does allow you to improve the lives of others and recognize your place in your community. Spreading kindness and generosity allows for your own happiness to be multiplies by the happiness of all those you assist. Additionally, the social bonds facilitated by working in your community are important to happiness. As Emile Durkheim's research on social ties shows, people are happiest when they have strong, people are happiest when they have strong relationships and onds within a community. Lacking ties to others leads to a anomie, a disconnection that can have profoundly negative impacts on ones pshyche.

They argue that setting boundaries, focusing on yourself, and doing whatever you need to feel good are key ways to live. Others should always be secondary to your own pursuit of happiness.

This focus on self-interest has positive aspects but has swing too far in a bedonistic and selfish direction. The Kantian view of this problem is illuminating: what if everyone in society were to behave purely in their own self-interest?

Society fails to function if we are not in some ways looking out o for one another.

There is no need to live the life of the ascetic and disregarded all personal desires and goals but one must think of others if they are to be truly happy.

People are more likely to experience happiness if they focus on their own personal goals because humans, being social creatures, require each other to live and flourish as a whole community.

Freedom of choice is an important characteristic of the human condition.Countries throughout the history of humanity have fought and died for their freedoms. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize that being free to choose is key to experiencing happiness. Some people may argue that people need to be governed and directed for their own good. This is a false argument. People who believe this argument to be true mistakenly believe that the feeling of control they get from exerting their will onto others will satisfy their needs for security. This is how revolutions begin and empires fall. Each and every great empire has fallen due to power struggles.

Once an individual is liberated from the choice to sacrifice their autonomy in order to survive, society as a whole can begin to flourish. Take a look at the science fiction television show, Star Trek. The galactic federation in that show represents a futuristic community where all basic human needs are met: food, shelter, security, love and freedom. When all of these human needs are provided for, the individuals are free to choose their own career path, their love life, and even their leisurely pursuits. I believe the global human society needs to follow in the foot steps of this fiction in order to have a chance at attaining a happier society.

While I do think it is possible for human beings to feel happy when they are focused on goals besides their own happiness, I think this philosophy invites too many instances of abuse. Dictators have risen to power throughout history with the promise of happiness if, and only if, citizens sacrifice their own freedom to acheive the goal of the despot. That goal is absolute power over others, a sinister and self-centered desire fueled by primitive and personal psychological wounds. I believe most dictators would fall under several pathological antisocfial categories. Take a look at Putin and his rule over Russia. He persuades and commands his people to die for him, yet owns a 700 million dollar super yacht--and this is just the tip of the iceberg concerning his immeasurable wealth. How can someone like Putin so easily command the death and destruction of a neighboring country, let his own people starve and wallow in poverty, and enjoy such luxuries? We might say that putin himself experiences happiness, but to ignore the terror and distraught his goals have on his people and those around him would be missing the point.

In conclusion, humanity's happiness would greatly improve once basic needs are met for everyone, and everyone has the choice to follow their own passions and dream.

394,MATERIALISM,"Modern society should be criticized for being too material because material because materialism is detrimental to the planet and detrimental of the wall being of humans. Materialism in a society leads to people amassing goods that they do not need and results in a huge waste of resources. For example, many people are obsessed with fashion and as a result purchase more clothing than they need. The textile industry is one of the leading sources of pollution in the United States consuming and disposing of chemicals and dyes used in the processing and manufacture of cloth and textiles. Cotton requires fertilizers which pollute streams and groundwater. Synthetic fabrics are made of chemicals or petroleum which also pollute the soil, groundwater, and surface water. Additionally, the excess clothing ultimately ends up the landfills.
 Focus on material goods also convinces people to work longer and longer hours to be able to afford larger houses, bigger cars, and the latest electronic devices. Because people are working longer hours, they are spending less time pursuing leisure activities, relaxing, or enjoying time with their families. In  general, possessions do not bring the same level of happiness that experiences, friendship, and love offer. As work hours become longer, people becomes less happy. The pursuit of material goods is adding stress to people's lives and generally resulting in a lower quality of life.
Because the gross national product is a measurement of the health of the economy, it could be argued that purchasing material goods is need to keep our nation strong. I belive this insistence that the economy must grow every year to be healthy is a fallacy promoted by corporations to ensure continued profits. Corporate greed promotes materialism by producing advertisements aimed to convince the population they need more and/ or newer products. In the absence of corporate advertising, many people wouldn't even realize a product exists or that they ""need"" it. A healthy economy should simply mean that the goods and services people need or want are available and that the majority of the population has access to a job that allows them the financial means to acquire the goods they really need in addition to a few extras.

396,COMPETITION,"The winner of the game may not be the Most Valuable Player. One person does not carry the whole team and an individual cannot be all things to all people. There is an on going argument in the world as to whether cooperation or competition help people to achieve more success. However, life and history seem to have proven that cooperation makes for the best results

Cooperation between parties is essential for overall success. One individual cannot possibly complete all tasks, particularly on large projects. One individual cannot amass and maintain all of the skills needed to complete the work that must be done. Think of a ball team: a player cannot be both defense and offense. The player would become exhausted quickly and the performance would suffer. Most players have natural talents and areas of expertise. Individuals cannot be the best receiver, the best quarterback, and the best tight end, even if he could be in three places at once. Working in cooperation brings overall success to a project and can speed up the completion of a project. That would ultimately allow for more work to be done as tasks and projects can be completed more quickly. Cooperation also breeds helpfulness and community.

Some people may argue that competition is better. Some people are driven by competetion, but what good would it be to have two competing groups working on a single project? It would be more productive and more successful to have each group working on a separate project and get two things successfully completed. Some would argue that competition will push individuals to preform better, and then you could, of course, pick the best. However, the world does not run on individuals. Competition may be helpful in small and certain scenarios, but overall, cooperation is essential to survival. If our world and research. If time and money are both poured into competition then we cannot use those resources for betterment. Perhaps competition could lead to a better discovery. Yet, a cooperation of great minds and expert talent would go much farther than the chance that competition could produce somthing more useful.

So, yes, competition may havei ts own place. It may be beneficial at times. Yet, cooperation can always reild beneficial and successful results. Cooperation will take projects further and faster that competing groups or individuals. Cooperation will also save on resources like time, money, and consumables, as multiple groups are not trying to do the same project. Our world depends on cooperation to run and cooperation will lead to the most successful and long-lasting accomplishments.","The winner of the game may not be the Most Valuable Player.

Cooperation between parties is essential for overall success. One individual cannot possibly complete all tasks, particularly on large projects. One individual cannot amass and maintain all of the skills needed to complete the work that must be done. Think of a ball team: a player cannot be both defense and offense. The player would become exhausted quickly and the performance would suffer. Most players have natural talents and areas of expertise. Individuals cannot be the best receiver, the best quarterback, and the best tight end, even if he could be in three places at once. Working in cooperation brings overall success to a project and can speed up the completion of a project. That would ultimately allow for more work to be done as tasks and projects can be completed more quickly. Cooperation also breeds helpfulness and community. 

Some people may argue that competition is better. Some people are driven by competetion, but what good would it be to have two competing groups working on a single project? It would be more productive and more successful to have each group working on a separate project and get two things successfully completed. Some would argue that competition will push individuals to preform better, and then you could, of course, pick the best. However, the world does not run on individuals. Competition may be helpful in small and certain scenarios, but overall, cooperation is essential to survival. If our world is in constant competition we cannot support growth and research. If time and money are both poured into competition then we cannot use those resources for betterment. Perhaps competition could lead to a better discovery. Yet, a cooperation of great minds and expert talent would go much farther than the chance that competition could produce something more useful. 

So, yes, competition may have its own place. It may be beneficial at times. Yet, cooperation can always yeild beneficial and successful results. Cooperation will take projects further and faster that competing groups or individuals. Cooperation will also save on resources like time, money, and consumables, as multiple groups are not trying to do the same project. Our world depends on cooperation to run and cooperation will lead to the most successful and long-lasting accomplishments.",4.5,0.978325859
397,MATERIALISM,"We live in the age of stuff. Tecno-stuff, media-stuff, food-stuff, and stuff-online --among many, many others. It's easy to get overhelmed by just how much stuff is out there, because think about it: if just one million of the billions of people on the planet produced just one Thing--whatever it is --every day (could be a news article, a social media post, a phone app, a new recipe...), then in seven days there would be at least seven million new Things for you to peruse, look over, absorb, read, utilize, etc. As our population gorws, our stuff grows, and it's all too easy to start to yhink, well, this must be materialialism. But is it? How do we define materialism today, anyway?

It used to mean the accumulation of so much stuff that you truly had too much, and it wasn't just stuff--it was stuff acquried for the sake of impressing others or for feeling like you had all the latest stuff, but more then anything else, it was supposed to be stuff you just didn't need. But who define what we need, anyway? Isn't that up  to each of us trash is another man's treasure"" sure seems applicable. One person's materilism might be another person's prudent investment.

It can be dizzying to keep up with just the physical stuff--clothes, technology devices, media like books, movies, games, etc. But now there is what can easily become even more overwhelming--stuff that is purly digital. Can you become meterialism when it comes to that's? Too may social media accounts? Too many recipes you've bookmarked online? Too many news articles you read yesterday? Doe 'materialism' even have a place in today's world? 

The question changes with the times, and so, too, does the answer, so: it depends. It depends on who we're talking about, and what they have, and why they have it, and what it costs--them, and socity. After all, who are you harming if you own 100 cars? Well, the environment, for one, if you actually drive all 100 of those cars versus just the one that somedohy else has.

But is it materialistic to just own something by the sheer numbers? What if somebody who makes $12,000 a year owns 500 differ air fresheners for their car? Are they materialistic when it comes to aiar fresheners? That sure seems hard to say. But let's flip it and say somebody who makes $120,000 a year has the same thing-- one car, 500 air fresheners. One person's quirky indulgence suddenly becomes somebody else's greedy uselessness. 'What a cute collection' turns into 'what on Earth does anyone need so many air fresheners for? You have all that money and look what you could be actually be spending it on!'

So should modern socity face criticism for materialism? It depends. I'd say, the higher the income, the more likely you are to find it. But how many times have we heard of people with lower incomes spending their money unwisely on splashy things when they'd do better to save it? But who is to actually say that? So when it depends, does it really depend on who we're judging--or on who is the one doing the judging?

Like anything, we might do best to look for the most concrete, logical answer --it depends a whole lot less when you can see a physical, quantifiable reslt. Materialism starts to really matter and 'depend' a lot less when things like consumption and collection of plastic goods leads to miles and tons of plastic pollution in ocean. Or when so many want the newest, the latest device and discard the old that was in perfectly find working condition--and all that waste accumulates in landfills, and products come out cheaper,faster, and lower quality to keep up with demand so that even the most cautious consumer can't keep their device as long as they used to from simple wear and tear.

398,HAPPINESS,"Happiness is something that we all long for. It is part of human nature to want happiness. Many of us find it, while others do not. So, then, how does one find happiness? I argue that happiness is somethin we find when we pursue or own personal goals while simultaneously striving for the betterment of humanity. In this essay, I will elaborate on this, as well as debunk oppsing arguments on this topic.

The formula for happiness consists of two components. The first component is that one must have their own personal goals and dreams that they are striving to achieve. These goals must be measurable and attainable. For example, a goal of mine is to save up enough money to buy a house. This goal is measurable because I am able to see exactly how much money I have saved at any point in time. This goal is attainable because I have the means to put aside money each day. you may be wondering, though, ""How does a personal goal relate to happiness?"". Let me elaborate. When we set goals for ourselves, no matter how big or small, and achieve them, we learn to trust ourselves. When we trust ourselves, we build a sense of self-efficacy, and thus, confidence. Confidence is an attribute that carries into all aspects of life. Research shows that people who are confident, also tent to be happier.

The second component in finding happiness is to strive for the betterment of humanity, Research shows that creating positive experience in life generates more positive experiences. It is like a ripple-effect. In addition, when we are doing good for others, we often feel good ourselves. There is joy in spreading kindness and putting in the effort to make the world a better place for all. Therefore, if we put time and energy into bettering humanity, by means of charity, volunteering, or any sort of conscious effort, we are going to fell those effects ourselves.

Some argue that happiness can be found by either achieving our goals, or by improving humanity. However, I argue that we need both of those components to find happiness. Happiness is not possible if we focus solely on ourselves, as we need human interaction and positive reinforcement from other in order to gain happiness. In contrast, we cannot find happiness if we focus solely on improving humanity. This is because we would be neglecting ourselves in the process. True happiness can only be found when both of these components are woven together.

Overall, I believe that happiness can only be achieved when we focus on our own personal goals as well as the improvement of humanity. In life we need to find a balance of the two in order to find happiness for ourselves. By interesing our personal goals as well as our goals for humanity, we can alol attain true happiness.","         Happiness is something that we all long for.

399,COMPETITION,"There are many varied opinions on the usefulness of competition as a driving motivator to achieve successful outcomes in pursuits of all forms. The typical thought is that competition makes people strive to be the best and as a result creates higher quality output than if they were not in competition with others. In recent years however, more attention has been given to the idea that cooperation can better serve to produce good outcomes which continue to increase for longer periods of time.

While competition can be a useful motivator and does yield results, it can also lead to problems such as tension, stress, anger, and other similar interpersonal conflicts which have the opposite effect of decreasing productivity. On the other hand, cooperation leads people to feel connected and appreciative of one another, supporting the work as a whole. Together people work towards accomplishing a shared goal and realize that what benefits the individual benefits the advancement of the work for everyone.

For example, a competitive project where bonuses are awarded to only top performers may lead to people actively attempting to sabotage the work of their competitors so that they can gain advantage. Even if they do not interfere with other's work, they will not offer any help since their individual goal is to be on top. But in a cooperative structure where everyone is awarded, no one would be motivated to disrupt the work of any one else and instead would be motivated to help their fellow workers since the goal is shared by all.

Some may say that cooperative goals are not as effective at driving people to work as hard as they would when in a competitive state, and while this may be true in the short term, the long term benefits outweigh any initial losses. 
The cooperative team maintains a healthy working dynamic which only grows as more time passes, while the competitive team will grow weaker as individuals become more disconnected from one another and disenfranchised when they do not perform well.

In today's world, it is becoming increasingly clear that to grow towards a healthier and more productive working environment we must give more attention to a philosophy of cooperation in the workplace. The more commonplace this becomes, the more it will branch out and help to create a world where we all work together for a shared benefit.","There are many varied opinions on the usefulness of competition as a driving motivator to achieve successful outcomes in pursuits of all forms.

 To begin, the production and consumption of objects is a necessary part of human existence. Humans rely on shelter and agriculture to survive and thrive. Beyond that, humans tend to take pride in their possessions in addition  to their use in sustaining llife. For example, look at Soviet-style apartment blocs. Ugly, grey and beige buildings with little to distinguish them from each other versus unique constructions found throughout the rest of the world. One type is dull and grim, the other is a source of pride foor its owner. It's another oversimplification, but soviet-style construction is on the way out in the developed world while the other style is thriving. The disdain felt for ghettoes and Soviet apartment blocs can only prove to some extent the pride of ownership many people feel for their dwellings and possessions beyond their utilitarian aspects. some level of materialism can be useful to society and should be encouraged.

An argumen t against this line of thinking might be that any level of materialism can be a slippery slope to an obsession that negatively affects one's life. For example, think of a parent wh spends an inordinate amount oof their time shopping when they should be spending time with their children.

Every person knows their own life best,and moreso is responsible for that life.

I felt that I made a wonderful difference in their lives by providing for their needs in a hospital.

403,COMPETITION,"In this day and age, a debate is being waged over the benefits of competition versus cooperation. Specifically, this debate is aimed at the influence of competition and cooperation on personal success. Indeed, many organization have thrown their chips in on either sode, investing in things like performance incentives, on the one hand, or initiatives like company retreats and open workspaces, on the other.

When it comes to personal success, however competition is the key. Individuals require a competitive environment in order to achieve maximum results.

There are several reasons for this. First off, negative motivation compels humans to act more strongly than does positive motivation. This has evolutionary roots. If a person were being chased by a predator in the wild, this provides a much stronger compulsion to act than the possibility of finding extra food or resources, to give but one example. As a species, we're hardwired to conserve energy, and we therefore require an unpleasant stimulus before we act. Competitive environments provide this stimulus. Though some people have the discipline to act on internal motivation, they are the exception and not the rule. Generally speaking, most people will respond more powerfully to hostile competitive environment. 

Beyond the motivation paradigm, one must take into account the very definition of personal success. Personal success is an individual achievement, and is thus achieved in isolation. Cooperation is diametrically opposed to this concept. Indeed, cooperation implies some degree of personal sacrifice or compromise in the interest of a group, necessarily limiting personal achievement. By creating a competitive environment, individuals are forced to look at their achievements in stark relief with those of others, thus poising them for action and growth. 

Some may argue in favor of cooperation, and indeed, one can see how cooperation may achieve positive results. Communication between team members, sharing of knowledge, and division of labor may all results in a net gain for an organization or community, but that's exactly the problem. The issue at hand is personal success, not corporate success. Those at the top have something to gain from coopration amongst inferiors. Furthermore, cooperation may indeed help some people to be more personally successful, but these people are the slackers and underachievers. Cooperation will serve to shore up their deficits while taking away from those who could have achieved more on their own.

In summary, it is competition which drives personal success. Competition provides the catalyst and the mechanism for personla success, coming in the form of negative motivation and an individualistic mindset, respectively. Though cooperation can achieve results for large-scale interests, it doesn't create the right conditions for personal success.","     In this day and age, a debate is being waged over the benefits of competition versus cooperation.

    Beyond the motivation paradigm, one must take into account the very definition of personal success. Personal success is an individual achievement, and is thus achieved in isolation. Cooperation is diametrically opposed to this concept. Indeed, cooperation implies some degree of personal sacrifice or compromise in the interest of a group, necessarily limiting personal achievement. By creating a competitive environment, individuals are forced to look at their achievements in stark relief with those of others, thus poising them for action and growth.
     Some may argue in favor of cooperation, and indeed, one can see how cooperation may achieve positive results. Communication between team members, sharing of knowledge, and division of labor may all result in a net gain for an organization or community, but that's exactly the problem. The issue at hand is personal success, not corporate success. Those at the top have something to gain from cooperation amongst inferiors. Furthermore, cooperation may indeed help some people to be more personally successful, but these people are the slackers and underachievers. Cooperation will serve to shore up their deficits while taking away from those who could have achieved more on their own. 
     In summary, it is competition which drives personal success. Competition provides the catalyst and the mechanism for personal success, coming in the form of negative motivation and an individualistic mindset, respectively. Though cooperation can achive results for large-scale interests, it doesn't create the right conditions for personal success. ",4.5,0.984176127
404,HAPPINESS,"Many people have questions about how to obtain true happiness, and the answer isn't so simple. It is my belief that people are happier when they focus on their own personal goals rather than on the happiness of othrs. If you are successful in achieving your goals (even if, say, your goal is to make others happy) this will have a spiraling effect on the rest of your life. For example, someone who sets a goal for a promotion at work (even if the have to wait years to get it) will be much happier once they get it, instead of seeing another co-worker getting that same promotion instead. But it doesn't even have to be a very complicated/hard to achieve goal that makes you happy.

A small goal, like finding twenty minutes to read a good book every night, can also give you pleasure. In fact, it's often the smaller goals in which we derive the most satisfaction from. Consider how happy you might be after you've had a good meal on an empty stomach. So you can see, it doesn't have to be an overly complicated task of accomplishment to get you thinking positively.

But what about the happiness of other? Can't the happiness of others also make you happy? It can - especially if they happiness is coming from someone you care about a great deal. But every person is different and there are different factors that have to be taken into account when you relt on others to find happiness. What if the people in your life aren't happy? Should you not be happy as well? What if they are happy, but they don't share any of their happiness with you (like withholdhing the things that bring them joy)? It is also true that many might get jealous at other people's happiness, if they themselves are not happy. This might even cause them to feel even worse about their predicaments.

Whatever the case, while others in your life can make you happy, it's best not to try to leech off their happiness for your own benefit. It is also important to remember to set acheivable goals, and maybe find an appreciation for the little things in life - like a good book or a warm meal.

405,COMPETITION,"People achieve more success by cooperation than competition. Humans have evolved to socialize and cooperate as a group; this is how humans managed to survive and thrive over eons. The rugged individualist can't build giant temples and monuments or travel to space on their own. I heard at my old job at a semiconductor factory that they stopped using competition as a motivator to make people work harder because it made people less honest, if i recall correctly. My old job saw better results when they switched to a more cooperative mindset across shifts.

Cooperation also allows people to have different roles in society. for example, someone can  dedicate their lives to practicing medicine while someone else farms crops for a living. If people always had to compete directly, it would discourage people from focusing on one area like medicine since people would have to still worry about food production. without cooperation, we wouldn't have people highly skilled in certain areas and the standard of living and life expectancy would decline for everyone as a whole.

In my own experience, I have definetely achieved success competing rather than cooperating, but only on an individual basis and not as a group. In school, in particular, I would put a lot of time into my projects and studies to beat the other students and I often got better grades and results, but it did not prepare me well for the real world where people need to work together as a group to achieve their goals for their organizations.

In conclusion, while competing may produce better results onan individual basis, it does not produce better results for groups, organizations, and societies; my own experiences, knowledge, and reasoning shows this to be true.","People achieve more success by cooperation than competition.

407,COMPETITION,"Often when people think of cooperation, they think of family, sports and the workforce. Cooperation is the idea that individuals work together to acehive a specific task or common goal. In sports, people are encouraged to cooperate and work together for a common goal: to win a game. In the workforce, oftentimes, the boss gives an assignment and colleagues work together to either learn together while accomplishing the task at hand or complete specific parts to complete the whole task. Even on a closer, more familial level, cooperation is something that builds bonds, establishes relationships and creates long-lasting memories.

Cooperation aids in the success of famalies because it builds and strengthens relationships; wheter its spouses, siblings, in-laws or other relatives. Working together isn't always easy within families, but it allows for members to make memories and become closer. While athletes often examine their own abilities and strenghts and weaknesses, most of the time, they work side by side with other like-minded players to get better, stronger in their sport. Their goal is to win the game. With team sports like basketball and football, players often rely on each other to work together to execuste plays that will help them score points. THis cooperative mindset, ultimately builds the best player and athlete, because they realize the game is not just about them, but about the entire team. There are jobs in the workforce where people can work solely on their job duties and not have to interact with people at all. And there are others who have to interact with people all day. Cooperation within working environments builds character, develops strong communicates and helkps people indeitnyi their own strong attirubtes that bring to the table.

408,MATERIALISM," Materialsm has been a function of society since the first rise of civilizations. It was a way to measure personal accomplishment, provide hedonistic pleasures and part of the economic engine of society. As all aspects f society, structure, techology, medicine, education and others have advanced so has the opportunity to obtion meterial goods. Beyound the, it is ingrained in to people that more stuff means more success. As an anecdote, as I was growing up, a popilar saying was 'the one who dies with the most toys...wins.'

Materialism, however, does have practical purposes. Producing goods emplys people and gives them oportunities to have easier and more pleasant lives. It also allows for development of practical and beneficial items to improve society and allow the producers more economic resources to develo new goods for societal consumption that can increase productivity and improve life.
         
For good or bad, peaple have been taught t measure success by the goods they can acquire and measure success by the goods they can acquire and measure themselves against each other by what they possess beyound the material things that give them what they need to live comfortable and secure lives. Where a basic car will provide mobility to improve productivity, a laxury car shows others that you are more successful in your efforts than most people. But it is more than just having a nicer version of something that creates criticism, it is often acquiring things that have no need to se resources to produce it.

But excessive materialism goes beyound the wase of resources. It is a eminder to people of the inequality of distribtion of resoures tha causes the criticims of materialism. Things are a tangible item that peaople can use as example as to why materialsim is bad.

Poeple are always going to want more things as they seek self validation for their existence and they are going to be irritated when other people hae more andnicer things than they do. It makes them feel like a failure or tha they are being judged, which they are because they do it themselves, by other people.

Society should be criticzed fir excessive materialsim. The world has enough resoureces to provide shelter, food and health services for evryoune on Earth. Creating things just to have thigs is not the most useful way to use the Earth's resources. However, people need to have incentives to be a productive force in the world. I there is no societal reward for working hard, than people will quickly fall to the lowest common denominator of productivity and necessary innovations to improve life will suffer.

Materialism is not thhe true problem, it is a measure of society's values and  beliefs. Changing beliefs is very difficult and tales time. People are angry at wealth distribution right now, angry about climae change and increasiong costs for basic services but have not been able to move forward to chage laws that would alleviae these issues. Often the argument cited is that te wealthy control the laws, that is the cynical golden rule, he who has the gold, makes the rules. The problem is definitely an elephant and the solution is how do you eat an elephant, one bite at a time.

Society needs to prioritize what is important and focus on one item at a time. This is much easier said then done because everyone's priorities are going  to be differebt and it is going to be difficult to move forward with any meaningful fixes unless people are willing to compromise and work together.

moving away from materialsm and allowing people to validate themselces through experiences rather than possessions would require a very large paradign shift in the values of the United States. It is also not an idea that will be easily sold in a society that has based its own self identification in its ability to produce goods and services for its population.

Materialism should not be criticized, simply because criticism makes people defensive. What needs to change is the emphasis on what makes a successful and happy life.

410,HAPPINESS,"What is happiness? Is it the receiving of gifts, like a child at Christmas? Or is it the giving of gifts, like a parent at Christmas? I believe it is the latter. I believe a child would tell you that it is the receiving of things, but as a parent, I can tell you that I have been much happier in my life when I have been on the giving end.

Whether you are giving something to your child or to a total stranger, the feeling that you get when you give is a satisfying, and yes, happy feeling. I worked in an office, sending people to collections for not paying their medical bills. I was getting paid for this, so I thought I was happy, but the work was not satisfying. Because I was not happy in my daily job, I was not good at volunteering my time, which meant I was not giving to others at all. A few years ago, I began working as a para in a Catholic school for 3rd and 4th graders. My job is to give extra help to kids who struggle academically. Every single time a child is successful because of the guidance I am able to give them, it feels like Christmas morning to me. This is the most rewarding thing I have ever done. I can now say that I am truly happy in my job, not because I am getting paid, but because I am helping others. This happiness in my job carries over to my family life, I am happier and therefore more willing to give at home as well.

I understand why some people believe that setting goals for themselves and reaching them is true happiness, and I believe this does play a part in someone's happiness. If you do not feel good about yourself and who you are, then it will be difficult to help others. For that reason, I think that people should definitely take care of themselves and attempt to reach their goals in life. Taking care of your own needs is important so that you are able to be there for others. Because of my own experiences in life, I am convinced that true happiness comes from helping others, not from reaching my own goals.

While I will admit I still like to receive gifts at Christmas, my true happiness has come from the gifts that I am able to give. I am extremely happy for myself and for those who I am able to help.

I can now say that I am truly happy in my job, not because I am getting paid, but because I am helping others. This happiness in my job carries over to my family life, I am happier and therefore more willing to give at home as well. 
     I understand why some people believe that setting goals for themselves and reaching them is true happiness, and I believe this does play a part in someone's happiness.  If you do not feel good about yourself and who you are, then it will be difficult to help others.  For that reason, I think that people should definitely take care of themselves and attempt to reach their goals in life.  Taking care of your own needs is important so that you are able to be there for others.  Because of my own experiences in life, I am convinced that true happiness comes from helping others, not from reaching my own goals.  
     While I will admit I still like to receive gifts at Christmas, my true happiness has come from the gifts that I am able to give. I am extremely happy for myself and for those who I am able to help.  I am also extremely grateful that I was able to figure this out. ",4.5,0.982378855
411,COMPETITION,"Success is nearly unquantifiable construct, and yet, most people can describe their definition of success and how they plan to achive it. There is much debate regarding the most effective way to pursue success, since it can occur in a wide variety of different ways. While there are proponents that cooperation with others is the most direct route to successful results, I believe innate competition to be a far more effective method driving positive accomplishments. Competition fosters more internal motivation to succeed, and allows success-seeking individuals (rather than groups) to be acknowledged for their efforts.

Competing with others for the same goal is much more effective at driving success than cooperating with others. Humans naturally 
compete - constantly comparing our own qualities, skills and ideas to those of others. This is done as a metric to assess our own performance, and gives a benchmark to which to aspire if and when taht performance is lacking. Falling short of others is an extremely strong motivation to improve oneself, especially when striving for the same goal.

This is in direct contrast with cooperation, which allows individuals to rely on teammates instead of working to better themselves. Cooperating with others is no doubt beneficial in some ways - it is often said that ""the team is greater than the sum of its parts"" (i.e., working together is more powerful than personal ability). However, relying solely on cooperation can allow unsuccessful team members to not pursue individual progress, since they can still be carried to success by those with whom they are cooperating. This, in turn, is damaging to that individual's chances of future success - as there is little internal motivation to improve.

Another reason that competition should be favored over cooperation in terms of achieving success is that nature of recognition for successes in each setting. It is intrinsic in human nature to want to be recognized for accomplishing something positive. Constantly working in cooperative settings will most likely lead to whole teams being lauded for success, which can lead to individuals within the team feeling marginalized or not appreciated for the extent of their contributions. This is no issue in competitive settings, wherein the competing individuals are vying for recognition independently.

Competition is everywhere in society, and for good reason. It provides a natural motivation for individuals to succeed, because human beings do not want to fall short of standards set by other human beings. It also leads to a more appropriate recognition of individual success compared to cooperative settings where it can be difficult to determine who achieved what. Thus, fostering competition in success-seeking situations will lead to a higher degree of success.","Success is a nearly unquantifiable construct, and yet, most people can describe their definition of success and how they plan to achieve it.

413,HAPPINESS,"One is more likely to find happiness from focusing on personal goals than on the happiness of others and there are several reasons for this. Happiness is somthing that needs to come from within. It comes from the mindset and attitudes toward life. One can increase happiness by learning to accept those things that they cannot change and by working on those things that they can. It is important to understand the difference here.

Basing our happiness on the happiness of thers is problematic. To begin with, we can not know the happiness of others. It is quite common for people to display only the happy pieces of their life on social media and to paint a much happier picture than their real life would reflect. If you are going to compare your real life to the glamorized version of everyone else's life, your life will almost always appear to come up short.

Another issue with basing our happiness on the happiness of others is that this is completely out of our control. We can do nothing to make ourselves happy if our happiness depends on what others are thinking or doing. We cannot control how happy someone else is no matter how hard we might try.

As a mother, it can be difficult not to base my happiness off the happiness of my children. But I can't do that because I cannot control how happy they are. Of course, I still strive to give them the best life possible and to teach them how to be happy but I can't allow my happiness to be dependent on their happiness.

On the other hand, we can find great happiness when focusing on personal goals. Staying mindful in the present moment and being grateful for the things that we have are two important pieces to maintaining happiness. Having a personal goal to focus on serves both of these. It keeps us living in the moment to having somthing to work on. It also helps us feel accomplished and thankful for what we have when we meet milestones along the way.

We might not always accomplish our personal goals, but the great things with personal goals is that they are in our control so we can adjust them or tailor them to fit our changing circumstances. This is important. Life is never what we expect it to be and if we want to be happy despite unforseen set backs, we need to adjust our expectations for ourselves in the process.

I have found that for me personally, the key to happiness is not any of those things though. The key is to find the happiness in each moment and to appreciate the things that you have in your life.

Would he have won if this was made known before the election? I can't say but voters should be made aware of all the facts and be allowed to make up their own minds.

In my opinion we need to redefine success, and focus more in cooperation. Historically, cooperation has been the only way to survive. People who didn't cooperate, hunting, gathering, farming - would die. Cooperating made the community stronger. It built social ties. Each person contribution their skill to the community as a whole, worked to strengththen and lift each other up.

Competition causes stress, anxiety and depression. I think more and more people today are realizing that toiling away every day is no way to go through life. I know a lot of people seem to thrive on the rat rae, but when they reach the end of their lives, what are they going to look back on? Did the things they gained really make them happy? Did they ""win"" at life?

No I think the person who was part of a family, a circle of friends, and a community will be happier at the end of their life. They can look back and be proud that they touched others, and were touched by others, that they formed friendships, and love, and made a small part of the world better by joining in with others to make a difference.

And don't forget that competion of a large scale is known as war. When countries refuse to cooperate, when they battle one another for territory, or over idealogical differences, it destroys lives.

I'm not saying that competition has no place in society. When competition remains firmly in the reamly of enjoyment, such as sports or games, then it can be enriching. But competing to survice means many get trampled on, left behind, made to suffer. As billionaires exploit the masses, the divide between the classes grows into a chasm. In a world where people are valued by what they can produce, means that many people simply aren't valued. The disabled, the elderly, the mentally challenged are valued less because they cant ""compete"". But if we value people simply because they are human, because they touch lives, have hope, have feelings, have dreams, Then we realize just hom powerful the act of cooperation is.

417,MATERIALISM,"It's pretty hard not to be materalistic in today's world. Even if we see materialism as something we should avoid, the world we live in now simply makes it too hard. With how much time we spend with ads being thrown in our faces, whether we like it not, it seems almost impossible to not give in. It has been known for as long as human lives have been documented, it really comes down to: money and spending money makes us happy. Having things, even if only a few, simply because we wanted to have them, brings people the utmost joy. I beleive it is unfair to criticize that to a point.

One of the many defends for ""hating materialism"" comes from the idea that it is a waste to spend money on unimportant things. People that do not have lots of money, know better than to spend it on unecessary items. Having come from a poor background, I can definitely agree to some point. Growing up, my family definitely had to be careful how they spent money. I was constantly reminded to focus on my studies in order to not have to struggle as an adult as my parents did. However as little money as my family had, my parents still enjoyed splurging every-now-and-then, even if it was something as small as a weekly meal at Burger King. And yes, I did grow up focusing on my studies and I am grateful to say that I am in a financially secure state. I give in just as much as the next person in my age group but I have also learned limits. I learned to appreciate everything and I worked hard to be able to dine out more than just once a week, and not just to fast food places.

As I stated before, it's really hard not to be materialistic. I however, believe that we, as a society, should not be criticized for materialism. It is those that become consumed with it to the point where they let their lives come to ruin, that should be ones eing criticized. Even then, there are programs designed to help shopping addictions. This is definitely a tough topic to talk about but there are simply too many factors to simply go one way or another. We can't even watch shows/movies, check social medias, or shop for food without companies throwing out ads to tempt the materialism we all have. Some give in more than others, but that does not make them better or worse than their counterpart.","It's pretty hard not to be materalistic in today's world.

And yes, I did grow up focusing on my studies and I am grateful to say that I am in a very financially-secure state. I give in just as much as the next person in my age group but I have also learned limits. I learned to appreciate everything and I worked hard to be able to dine out more than just once a week, and not just to fast food places.

As I stated before, it's really hard not to be materialistic. I, however, believe that we, as a society, should not be criticized for materialism. It is those that become consumed with it to the point where they let their lives come to ruin, that should be the ones being criticized. Even then, there are programs designed to help shopping addictions. This is definitely a tough topic to talk about but there are simply too many factors to simply go one way or another. We can't even watch shows/movies, check social medias, or shop for food without companies throwing out ads to tempt the materialism we all have. Some give in more than others, but that does not make them better or worse than their counterpart. ",4.5,0.992573176
418,HAPPINESS,"It is often stipulated that the key to life is finding happiness. Once one has happiness, one can, to some extent, be considered successful. However, that begs the question: what is happiness? Cultures have pondered on this notion for millenia. A general consensus is that happiness is a sensation felt by living creatures, which produces good ""feelings"" throughout. In essence, it is strictly pleasureable in nature, and, after all, what is the human being, if not pleasure seeking? As the human progresses through life, considerations on the true nature of happiness begin to arise. Is it self-created or does it depend on other, external circumstances? Akin to the debate of fate vs. free will, there is no chicken without the egg, and vice versa. That is to say, happiness does, to some extent, depend on both internal and external factors. However, happiness is primarily reliant on the individual and is, thus, individualistic in nature. If one were to focus on the development of self and reaching one's potential, one would, indeed, be more likely to be happier than otherwise; the decision to prioritize one's goals brings internal happiness on the basis of self-development, fulfillment and positive influence.

As it has often been said, and reformulated, throughout history, growth is an inherent part of the human experience. Whether it be tangible or intangible, physical or spiritual, every living being can say they have experienced growth in one way or another. Growth is a key to life. Consequently, growth is the catalyst for, and a fundamental part of, self-development. One who is self-developed, or on the journey towards it, is one who is under constant growth. Such growth and development produces feelings of pride, which, in turn lead to happiness. Without self-development, the human being can only cling to the present conditions and, given the human tendency to place more import on the negative, it will often leave the person with negative feelings and resentment.

Furthermore, there is the idea of fulfillment. Depending on the school of thought to which one subscribes, one can say that each person has a purpose in this life. To some, that purpose is evident from the get-go, while others spend the rest of their life searching for said purpose. Nonetheless, it is a crucial part of the human experience to place goals for oneself, whatever they may be. While these can range vastly, the fulfillment of said goals leads to belief in oneself and happiness. Furthermore, this belief in oneself and happiness, gives life purpose, creating a positive feedback loop. It is this purpose, indeed, that makes life bearable.

Lastly, it is evident that collaboration and interdependence is vital in this life. One is not alone in this world and must interact with other living beings to get along. It is easier to communicate and coexist with others once one can be trusted. However, this trust is not easy to come by. This trust can be established with persuasion, whether explicit or implicit. People tend to trust those who are established. That is to say, those who have some form of credentials to back up any requests they are making. In the case of the human being who follows his goals, there is an element of achievement by attaining those goals. This achievement translates as success in the mind of others and leads to a place of influence. A successful human being is one that can influence those around him. In turn, this influence serves to promote happiness, as interpersonal relations are core to the human experience and necessary for survival."," It is often stipulated that the key to life is finding happiness.

419,COMPETITION,"Competition can drive people to push themselves harder to achieve their individual goals; however, true lasting success in any career requires focusing on more than just ourselves. The old saying, ""It's not what you know; it's who you know"" applies here. That quote could be extended to add, ""...and how you are perceived by those who know you.""

Many people approach networking (including with others in their own organization) with only their own career and goals in mind. This is a mistake. The key to success in networking is to be geniunely interested in others, and embrace a spirit of cooperation. Instead of viewing your rivals as enemies, make friends with them. Ask yourself not jsut what others can do for you, but what you could do for them in turn, and what you can bring to the table as a whole. Only then can you be recognized as a valuable member of a team or network, which you can then use as leverage to rise up your chosen career ladder.

Many will argue that focusing on others' needs sets a person up to be taken advantage of. Often this is true. We may spend valuable time mentoring someone else, helping them with their work, or introducing them to key people, but then they never turn around and do the same for us. The best way to approach this is to think of investing in relationships as though it is any business venture of investment: Without taking risk, there is no potential reward.

It is also true that many of the most successful people have stepped on others in order to get where they are. For example, many have accused Bill Gates of this. However, people who have achieved a high degree of success also knew how to cooperate with others and memorized the tenants of Dale Carnegie's famous book, ""How to Win Friends and Influence People.""

420,MATERIALISM,"Most people in this world will voice their distaste when they find someone they know to be materialistic. However disgusted they are, though, materialism is most likely part of their personalilty as well. We as humans tend to feel annoyed at other's behaviour when we actually secretly do it ourselves. Modern society should be criticized not only for materialism but for this kind of hypocrisy.

What is materialism? The desire to have physical (material) possesions and to acquire more, such as cards, expensive clothing, designer handbags, jewelry, fine houses, collectables, and many other things.

Why is it despicable? Many claim materialism is despicable because it places an emphasis on greed, drives people to purchase excess (grossely beyond what they need for basic survival) and drives them into debt. The consumption also hurts the environment. More factories are needed to meet the demand that this can cause polluition. For example, carbon emissions from cars, particularly those expensive, gas guzzling cars, pollute the air and have contributed to the destruction of the ozone layer. If you belivee in global warming, mass consumption is believed to have caused climate change as well. Some claim the planet will eventually become inhabitable due to this. This harmful form of materialism is almost malevolent and gluttonous in nature and should be criticized.

Why isn't it despicable? If you have the means to acquire numerous possessions (meaning you can afford it) then why shouldn't you enjoy all the delightful things the world has to offer? There are many things you can buy and collect that are sustainable as well. You do not necessarily have to be  contributing to the destruction of the planet if you buy a lot of things. If you are conscientious, you might even help the world by pirchasing consumer goods from companies that work toward bettering the environment. This form of materialism is benign, even benevolent, and should not be criticized.

In summary, modern society should be criticized for HARMFUL materialism. It is up to each individual person to gauge whether or not their consumption is harmdul or benign.

421,HAPPINESS,"There are many opinions, and much research, about how people achieve happiness. Some people believe happiness is the result of achieving ones career and life goals or achieving important life milestones. Other people believe happiness comes from helping someone other than ourselves. I believe happiness must first start within ourselves, our own lives, and our own support systems.

I grew up in a small town as a Jewish LGBTQ person where there were few other Jewish people and even fewer openly LGBTQ people. This experience was very traumatizing and I propelled that traumatic injury into studying social justice in college. I also began volunteering for an LGBTQ organization. I became hooked on social justice and heloing others. I worked at an organisation for 10 years, 6 of which I served as executive director. I made a huge impact by helping local laws to get passed, ensuring all-gender restrooms in the new city hall, and helping thousands of people live better lives so that they could be happier. I turned an organisation around from being in the red to being one of the largest of its kind in the United States. I dedicated my life to this work, making less than market rate, working 60 hour weeks, working almost every weekend, serving on multiple nonprofit and business boards of directors, and constantly felling like I had the weight of the world on my shoulders.

Unfortunately, I became so wrapped up in helping others I stopped helping myself. I used my work helping others to avoid addressing mental health issues, neglected my friendships, and had a very strained relationship with my friends and family. Eventually, because I was so focused on other people happiness, and not my own, my professional life imploded and I was fired very publicly.

Getting fired publicly, and accused of awful things in the media, was even more traumatic than growing up in a small town. The organisation I worked for quickly hired a new executive director that made 150% of my salary. They defamed me through media statements, people attacked me constantly on social media, and I was afraid to leave my house. However, because my mental health was rapidly collapsing under the weight of a public shaming, I was very quickly diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. My friends and family were so supportive they all became one pillar towards my healing. I was completely burned out on helping others through my social justice work, and instead began to exclusively focus on helping myself. Eventually, when I started to feel a little stronger, I started helping my friends and family too.

I'm much more protective of my privacy and safety than I was before I lost my job. The PTSD nightmares also still occur and sometimes waking up from one impacts me for the rest of the day. I had never had dreams as vivid as I started having after I lost my job. I'm also much closer to my friends and parents now. While I don't go out of my way to help people I don't know anymore, I manifest a lot of joy by being there emotionally and when I assist my friends and family with something they need. I feel like I'm more focused on what's actually the most important to me in my life. As a result, I'm happier than I've probably ever been.

I had to focus on myself, and find my own happiness, before I could begin to find happiness in helping others again, I also learned how to better express boundaries so that I was no longer resentful when people asked me for help. I stopped talking to and putting energy into people who were simply never going to support me like I needed. Since I lost my job, my primary focus is both on my own happiness and on the happiness of the people I am closet to in my life. In working on my own happiness, I also know that it's okay to say ""no"" when something is too much for me to handle timewise and/or emotionally.

Perhaps there are some people who exclusively find happiness in helping others.

They generally purchased only what they needed and kept things for a very long time. They also did not discard something that could be reused.

I can feel texture of the green sofa the I dpent many hours lounging on after holiday meals. The room looked the same from when it was built in the 1960's all the way up untill around 2014. They had comfortable things and they were built to last. If you fast foraward to my parent's lifestyle, there is no doubt a difference. We moved many times.

431,MATERIALISM,"Materialism is very rampant in today's society. This is due, in part, to the ease of buying as well as the constant competitive nature of society which tells people that the more money they acquire, the more successfull they are. Materialism, however, is about much more than the mere act of acquiring material goods. Keeping this in mind, materialism should not be considered a positive term. 

Materialism serves as an never-ending reminder that the goods we own eventually start to own us. In our constant quest for acquiring enough to make us feel happy and successful, we only find that we are anything but happy and successful. This is because there will always be someone who has acquired more and is deemed more successful. Therefore, the chase is futile. We find ourselves in an endless cycle. 

I remember years ago at the beginning of my career, all I wanted was to purchase a small home. In my mind, this would mean that I had ""made it"". So I bought my first home. It was a small ranch house, and perfect for me. When I saw my friends, however, purchasing biggerr homes in nicer neighborhoods, I began to feel disgruntled. I began to question my decision. I began to feel less successful than my friends. It became like a competition, and it was one that I never seemed to win. No matter how I tried to keep up with them, there was always more. I found myself stretching my resources and being overworked - and it did not make me happier or more successful. All it did was stress me out. 

All of this being said, there are many who are able to acquire material things but still keep their heads about them. They do not allow what they own to own them. They continue to put relationships with family and friends above materialisim. This is the key. To these people, what they own is not the most important thing in their lives. Their sense of success comes from the relationships they have. If they were to lose their material goods, it would not devastate them. They would just work hard to replace what they lost without it upsetting their mental and physical health. 

Being materialistic is something everyone needs to avoid. It can negatively effect one's overall happiness and well-being. That being said, one can still have material goods. Just remember that these goods should not come first in your life. Your relationships with others should always take precedence over material things. 

Modern society should be criticized for putting so much emphasis on what people own. This causes undue stress and pressure to always keep up with others, acquiring more and more.

432,COMPETITION,"There was a television show in my childhood, I believe it was called the ''Wide World of Sports.'' In its opening credits, it showed marvelous feats of athletic accomplishment as well as terrifying incidents of athletic failure. The message was clear: being a world leader was not without risk and sacrifice.
In this day of participation trophies- where all participation is celebrated, a view of the world that divides people into two camps, winners and losers, seems outdated and even harmful. But is it? Does competition drive excellence? or is success better achieved through cooperation? Are competition and cooperation two distinct categories or are they better seen as poles on a continuum?
Surely most of us a certain age and athletic gracelessness remember with embarrassment our awkward time during high school gym. In a world governed by winners and losers, our role in life was clear. I suspect that there were more of us in ''that'' category than we would like to admit. The fact of the matter is that most of us were never destined to become athletes.
Perhaps our time in high school would have been better spent in more cooperative environments gaining confidence in our bodies and a chance to head off middle-aged spread by identifying lifelong hobbies that would have gotten us up off couch and spending time with our familes.
But does cooperation too come with cost? I recently became aware of a high school alumni that I only knew at a distance. He apparently started life without a lot of breaks of chances. But, he had dreams . I came to find out many years later that he ended up playing in the highly competitive NFL and  is now a motivational speaker.
Perhaps the coaches in high school helped to guide this young man on his way. Without the competition and clear rules that helped to shape him, would he ever have achieved his dreams? Did achieving his dreams really take anything away from the rest of us? And was it all competition that shaped him? He did, after all, play on a team.
I suspect that true success is guided by both competion and cooperation. Competition sometimes gets a bad rap, but it is not without rules. Cooperation put men on the moon and most endeavors we complete today require teamwork. Perhaps it is not the arguement of whether cooperation or teamwork help us most achieve success that is pivotal. Perhaps it is a function of better awareness of when and how much to apply either that dermines our success.","There was a television show in my childhood, I believe it was called the ""Wide World of Sports."" In its opening credits, it showed marvelous feats of athletic accomplishment as well as terrifying incidents of athletic failure. The message was clear: being a world leader was not without risk and sacrifice.

434,COMPETITION,"Cooperation, not competition, often produces the best outcomes in society at both the macro and micro levels. While many people think of competition as making each other better, the reality is that it results in far more destruction than building each other up and improving them. Competition puts people through the metaphorical meat grinder, often not allowing them to realize their true potential and, in some cases, crumble under the pressure they face. Meanwhile, cooperation is not ambigious in nature or in design. It is the process in which people build each other up in a variety of manners, such as asking and answering questions or lending positive words of support or positive feedback when someone does something well.

Cooperation, not competition, is actually the basis of what is thought of as the most competitive thing: sports.
Most sports are teams sports, whether it be basketball, football, baseball, hocky, or something else. These sports have teams face each other, yes, but they also are just that: teams. These teams work togrther on and off the field or court to make each other better. They spend countless hours helping each other shoot the basket, giving each other tips, running plays, or even just giving positive words of encouragement. During my time playing basketball, this is what I experienced; a helpful atmosphere where a group of teammates and coaches supportedmy growth on  and off the court. When I had issues shooting the ball, my team still trusted me and we cooperated with each other to have a successful championship, run. Had we had been internally competitive, I wouldn't have gotten to play and the toxic effects may have stopped our championship run. Kindness, not anger, solves so much in this world.

On a daily basis in work, I must work together with my coworkers and supervisors in a team-based setting. I'm sure some people approch working with their coworkers as competition to get ahead and get a promotion or raise, but that competitive attitude produces an environment where nobody is actually happy at work. If I have a question at work, my coworkers are more than happy to aanswer or assist in some manner, and the same is true if they may have some manner, and the same s true if they may have some sort of question for me or need me to help out. At the end of the day, we all work frpm the same group of items and they to be done in a timely manner. Rather than sticking to what's just assigned to us, we help out with each others' items when needed.
This degree of cooperation has produced in bonuses on a monthly level for the whole team, not just one individual. The success of the team and the company is how we succeed, so to just lookout for oneself is to be foolish.

Cooperation has produced the highest level of success in my life, whether it be recreationally or professionally. Competitive environments at work have torn me down and discouraged me, resulting in me leaving. I'm happy to say I have found the perfect approach in my work and that's through cooperation. Ultimately, we're all in it together on this planet, whether some people like it or not, so it's best we cooperate at every level to ensure the best outcomes possible.

436,COMPETITION,"I am writing to express my views on the question, ""Do people achieve more success can be acheived regardless of the stimuli or conditions before the achievement. However, I do think that success is found slightly more through cooperation than it is through competition. I also feel that competition leads to an increase in frustration and disappointment if success is not achieved. Individual  achievement and success can sometimes be hard to define and/or independent of one another. I believe cooperation leads to more success towards a goal than competition. 

The driving factor for cooperation as a means to success is tha ability to work towards a goal without focusing on the downfall of another group. Competition helps drive people to want to succeed, but it may also have a negative effect. Cooperation can also help drive people to succeed without the negative stimuli that often arises through competition. Whether an individual or group is driven by competition or cooperation, all that matters is whether the needs of the goal are met. An important example to describe this division might be two people working on a puzzle. The mindset of who places the most pieces would be a competition driven stimuli towards the success of completing the puzzle. The competition mindset focuses on placing pieces as quickly as possible to achieve success in a winner and lose scenario. The cooperative mindset also focuses on placing pieces as quickly as possible. However, everyone is a winner in this scenario. Cooperation allows the two players to use teamwork and help one another while competition turns focus away from team towards the individual> Hindering other players becomes a factor and could ultimately reduce the timetaken to achieve success. Competition could also be between competing groups unlike this example, but the same factors apply where competition focuses porimarily on the goal while cooperation focuses on the pieces. Focusing on an outcome gibes rise to many problems.

By looking at the example of two players completing a puzzle, we see that completing the puzzle as quickly as possible could be the goal for success, In this scenario, cooperation is advantageous while competition can drive division. Competition, therefore, slows down the process of completing the puzzle.

437,MATERIALISM,"Materialism is controversial. To a certain degree, we cannot live without at least some material goods, yet it is also easy for most of us to strive, perhaps without realizing it, to live in excess. With today's concern regarding the effects of dire climate change likely within many of our lifetimes, excess consumption and the over accumulation of ""things"" becomes an important topic to discuss.

I maintain that we may actually become happier and lead a less stressed life if able to work toward a more minimalist lifestyle. For example, if needing to relocate from one home to another, it is much easier and less expensive if at the time of the move you're only living with the items you really need and actually use. (Of course, it isn't really appropriate to dispose of everything, move, and then buy everything all over again!) Another example is having, say, an excess number of certain clothing items. Might it be you have 15 pairs of shoes, but throughout a given month or year only actually wear 3-4 of those pairs of shoes? Could you have simply not acquired those extra shoes in the first place and lived on without issue?

At least in the United States, it is obvious many Americans are overbuyinh during especially the last three months of the year; October through December. Halloween candy is advertised as early as August. Thanksgiving for many is a time to eat as much as possible, with there probably also being much wasted food. Black Friday sales (?) encourage people to show up extremely earlywait in long lines, and then ""fight"" fellow shoppers for the best deals. Deals on items they may not even need. (Is someone literally going to die if they don't have that large screen TV in their life?) And then there's Christmas. Who, these days, considers one gift given from one to another 'sufficient'. Especially for children, there are often several, 5-10 gifts or more, received.

There are, of course, opposing views to all of this. A common phrase is akin to ""You only live once. I'm going to enjoy life right now while I am here."" (There is also the concept of ""You cannot take it with you."" So, isn't it selfish, greedy, to be accumulating all of this ""stuff"", much of which may be of no use ot not wanted after one's death?) Another line of thinking is ""I worked hard for my money and so I'm going to spend it as I wish.""

Something I'd like everyone to remember is we really do have limited space an limited resources, with an ever growing population. How is what we are doing, collectively, sustainable? What will life be like for children born today when they are 60 years old? There is already more than enough poverty.

Mankind does live in a physical world and coexits with material things.Some of these are necessary to maintain that existence-for eaample, the basic survival needs of food,water,and shelter.Materialism doesn't capture these elements, though,instead,it refers more to a hedonistic quality.

And, while a family can shelter successfuly in a thatched hut, there is a higher level of comfort-and perhaps security-in a sturdy house.

439,COMPETITION,"I believe that people achieve more success by cooperation than competition. While competition may provide a bit of a push to get where you're going, cooperation will get you there faster and with better results. I believe in this world, the more help you have, the better your results.

When you are in competition with people, it can be a long and lonely process. You are constantly under pressure to produce ideas, and then to protect those ideas from the people with whom you are competing. You won't know how much success you have until your project is done, and by then it may be too late. Additionally, you run the risk of closely duplicating someone else's idea, by accident. If they get their idea out of the gate first, you will be out of luck. Rivalry can cause stress and anxiety as you wonder what your competitors are doing and whether they will beat you to the punch.

In contrast, when you are working in cooperation with people, you have help generating ideas. You have other minds to bounce things off of, helping to refine the ideas and continuously improve until you get the one that you all agree is perfect. Often with teamwork,  you will have people who think differently from one another, providing various solutions to work through problems that you may not be able to work through on your own. When you get stuck, you can ask your team members for ideas. When they get stuck, they can ask you.

Some people do not like to share the glory with a team, and would rather keep it all for themselves. However, I feel like success is multiplied by the number of people with whom you can share it.

","I believe that people achieve more success by cooperation than competition. While competition may provide a bit of a push to get where you're going, cooperation will get you there faster and with better results. I believe in this world, the more help you have, the better your results. 

When you are in competition with people, it can be a long and lonely process. You are constantly under pressure to produce ideas, and then to protect those ideas from the people with whom you are competing. You won't know how much success you have until your project is done, and by then it may be too late. Additionally, you run the risk of closely duplicating someone else's idea, by accident. If they get their idea out of the gate first, you will be out of luck. Rivalry can cause stress and anxiety as you wonder what your competitors are doing and whether they will beat you to the punch.

In contrast, when you are working in cooperation with people, you have help generating ideas. You have other minds to bounce things off of, helping to refine the ideas and continuously improve until you get the one that you all agree is perfect. Often with teamwork, you will have people who think differently from one another, providing various solutions to work through problems that you may not be able to work through on your own. When you get stuck, you can ask your team members for ideas. When they get stuck, they can ask you.

Since no man (or woman) is an island, so to speak, it's good to cooperate to create a win-win situation. However, there are limits to this.

The way advertisements are used to persuade individuals to look favorably on a product is very fascinating. It appears that quite a bit of psychological research has been dedicated to this field. Instead of trying to use words to persuade, we are now focused on the use of images to entice. We now use our own influences and experiences to entice us to do, and be, like the people we see in these adverisement. Brilliant! Except that these advertisements are edited for things and situations to appear perfect. The reality is that perfections that we see is not the ""real-world"" reality but instead a method used to entice our brains to purchase or partake of something that in reality may not be attainable.

Public figures spend exorbitant amounts of time and money on clothes, makeup, and other effects to ensure that they have the ""perfect"" image before going into the public eyes. How many times have we mindlessly given more attention to the person that appears more polished, better dressed, or overall more beautiful? The bias is built in before a single word escapes their mouth. The facts or arguments that emerge appear to have lesser impact than the actual appearance. This is can be deterimental in certain situations because when we think of people in power, we want smart, competent, reliable individuals.

There are instances where appearance speaks volumes. For example, those that take the time to groom themselves appropriately before a job interview show that they consider that they are about to do to be of importance. They start off in a good light and then, providing that they are well-prepared in other areas of the interview, they may land the job. However, what if this is a person who cannot afford the best clothes or somehow managed to end up in unfortunate circumstances where they cannot even afford to have a clean or pressed shirt, yet they are well, or maybe more qualified that the well-dressed individual? What happens then? Do they get a fair chance? One would hope that in the case of a job interview, this would be the situation. Unfortunately, the reality may be otherwise.

Good things do not always come in nicely-wrapped packages and, as the cliche goes ""you cannot always judge a book by its cover"". We as a society need to remember to look deeper.

A counter-point for the discussion on cooperation vs. competition could lead to the possibility that competition leads to greater motivation and drive. While true to an extent, competition tends to do more harm than good. When emotions get in the way of objective work, disasters occur. The goal at hand becomes pushed aside; the real goal becomes being better than the other person. There might we a winner at the end, but that isn't without the pain of the process and a loser. Collectively, this is less success than a group would have by cooperating towards a common goal with the same motivations and outlooks. 
As much as both competition and cooperation are necessary, there has to be a limit on how far we push ourselves regarding the former. Our goal becomes a game of being better than one another. With a clear goal in mind, cooperation can shine through and become the winner for both an individual, group, and our collective society. A high level of competition is completely unecessary to achieving whatever goal we want. Once such a realization is made, we can call begin to unlock the power of cooperation in our live and achieve the success that we all desire. ",4.5,0.92139738
447,COMPETITION,"Success is something everyone strives to achieve. How we achieve success is something everyone must choose for themselves. No two people are alike in what motivates them and this unique diversity within the human condition is what truly decides the way we engage each other on our path to success. 

The best way to achieve success is to embrace both cooperation and competition. Competition drives us to new heights and pushes us outside our comfort zones. However, having rivals does not mean that you have enemies. Sometimes your rivals can be your biggest asset through the motivation they provide to achieve more and by offering unique perspectives to common problems. When we acknowledge that our journey to success is primarly a competition with ourselves and that our fellow competitors are taking the exact same journey in parallel, it becomes much easier to help one another race toward independent goals while furthering our own achievements. 

A perfect example of this type of cooperative competition would be the transportation terminal where my husband works. He is a truck driver that is paid by the load and he works with many other drivers that are all competing for loads of varying pay, difficulty and distance. Many drivers try to manipulate the dispatchers with ugly gossip about their coworkers to get themselves the best loads but the drivers that are the most cooperative with one another and with the needs of the terminal, before their own, are the drivers that receive the best loads. 

Creating an environment of cooperative competition may be difficult but it will reap rewards for everyone involved. Racing toward goals together is always more productive than losing your balance trying to trip up the competition. It only takes a couple of people to start a wave of cooperation within a group and then everyone begins working together towards greatness for all.","Success is something everyone strives to achieve.

448,MATERIALISM,"Modern society as a whole may be criticized for being materialistic but it would be unfair to criticize individuals who are part of this society for the same.  These individuals are simply enjoying the abundance, and enjoyment is a natural human feeling.

Materialism, though often thought of negatively, could also be though of as a positive reflection of society. The ability to be materialistic is reflective of a siciety that is rich enough that it is able to have an excess of money and possessions. Very few people would grgue that, if it has a choice, a society should opt for the unhappiness that hardship the lack of wealth and materials would bring.
 
A society possesses wealth and positions is one that, in most cases, has worked hard to do so. Of course, within societies there will be those whom are better and worse off, but if the society as a whole is better off, it is because, in generak, that tha society has worked together to become so. Now that the society is better off, it is natural progression that the members of that society have acquired more.

Once more (wealth, goods, etc.) is aquired, then the members of that society must also have leisure of time during which to care about acquiring more (i.e to be materialistic). Therefore, although many people criticize materialism, one could argue that it is prize that a society has been given for working hard to acquire such an abundance AND stablizing itself in such a way that the members of the society also still have the time and freedom with which to value things.
 Of course, one could make a very strong argument that materialism is unappealing. Most people would agree that we should value people and our reletionship over possessions and money. But while it is true that we should, most would agree that valuing possessions and money does not mean that a perosn does not value their relationships with others. Really, it could be argued that having the security of an abundance of possessions and money allows people to enjoy their relationships about meeting their basic needs of sustenance and shelter. Instead, they are able to focus on the relationships.

Therefore, one could argue that materialism actually allows for people to be, oddly enough, less materialsitic. So although moedern society can be criticized for being materialistic, one could provide a strong argument that the ability for those in a society to be materialistic is reflective of both a strong, stable society, as well as the resulting ability to also partake in any enjoy many non-materialistic things.

450,MATERIALISM,"Materialism in American society is contributing to a number of problems for the USA. Therefore, in my opinion, a concerted effort to reduce materialism in each American household needs to happen, although it will have a direct effect on the economy. Today's society should be criticized for being materialistic. 

Firstly, continuing to buy and buy and buy without regard to the financial consequences causes credit card balances to grow and grow. This creates a financial burden on the household and increases worry and stress. Secondly, there is not enough room to store all the newly purchased things. this causes old things to be thrown out. Most people will send that item to the trash. This increases landfill usage and created additional pressures on cities, counties and communities to handle all the trash. Some will even buy bigger houses in order to fit all the things in. Donating it and otherwise finding a way to recycle is the better solution. Thirdly, materialism contributes to global warming: the production of the item creates energy usage. If the item wasn't truly needed, then that energy usage just went to waste. If the item uses electricity, its usage contributes to global warming from its use. There is also the issue of shipping the item. If it comes from another country, the shipping of the item certainly creates more energy usage contributing to more global warming. Fourthly, materialism leads to lowering our valuation system. Having too many things and the ability to keep adding to that anytime something is wanted devalues everything. Nothing has importance. Items are too easily obtained. 

On the other hand, for some, having those items brings happiness, although short-lived. The production of those items creates jobs. In some third world countries, those jobs are incredibly important to the lives of the workers. The biggest effect of slowing materialism is on the economy. If we stop buying things we don't really need, then those workers don't get paid and might starve, the shipping companies won't have anything to ship and they will go under. The stores were the items are purchased will have less need to stock items and this will impact the number of workers required by the store. If stores don't have business, the store will close. 
This, then, leads to more empty retail spaces resulting in the energy used to create the space to be totally wasted. The American economy will increase issues with trade balances with other countries, and if the items are made in America, then American jobs will be lost and more people will need assistance through welfare and other benefits. 

Continuing to buy things that aren't truly needed lead to many problems. Slowing the purchase of these items is one way an individual can make a difference in slowing global warming, reducing landfill requirements and increasing overall good will through recycling for someone else in need. The economy will adjust to the changed needs. A household will be in a better position to pay off credit card balances. An individual will grow in appreciation of the items already owned and attach true meaning to how an item was acquired and its importance in being in the home.

Material possessions do not make us happy...just like the old saying goes ""money can't buy happiness"". Just don't let the money you have rule your life. Our money should come second to our family and the things they need.


It should certainly be spent on nsecessities before spending on our wants.

Taking everything into considseration, should we be criticized for having our ""toys""? I think not. We work hard, we play hard, and we have every right to spend our money the way we see fit. Does that mean we should? Absolutely not! We should save for our futures so we can have a comfortable old age. I'm sure there is a balance in there somewhsere of how much money we should spend and how much we should save, but I do not believe we should be criticized or undermined for spending our own money on the things we want.

Society in the world we live in today can be very materialistic, but all in all, I feel most people know how to control their money and purchases and they do okay for themselves. To sum it all up, no, I do not think modern society should be criticized for being a materialistic society, but I do think we should be reminded every now and then that we need to keep things under contro. Just a simple nudge will do!

","Material possessions can make us so happy...but do they really?  We go to work so we can earn money and then we go out and spend it.  Some people even spend more than they earn.  Mateial possessions make us feel good.  You see, we want to be better than our neighbor and have more ""toys"".  Having the most ""toys"" can indicate to others that we have ""made it"" in life.  Why do we feel as though we have to have more and be better than others?  Are we just not happy with our life unless we have the most?

People think that there are many ways for us to achieve happiness, however, without focusing on our own personal goals, we can never expect to achieve it. In this essay, I will give my rational for believing this way, address those who believe that our own happiness derives from helping other achieve their's, and wrap it all together in a succinct conclusion.

If you do not focus on your own happiness, ou will never become happy. Imagine a person stuck in the same dead-end job that's made them unhappy for a long time. If they do nothing, they will continue to be unhappy with their work. However, if they focus on their own personal goals, they could gain the skills they need to quit their job and begin the career of their dreams. This example relates back to each one of us, we need to focus on overcoming what is holding us back from achieving our dreams and experiencing true happiness. Additionally, it is known that vision boards and mindfulness exercises rely on the individual to actively use their brain to focus on themselves. Given all of this information, it is easy to see that personal happiness begins with the individual actively focusing on it.

My opponents say that focusing on the happiness of others is how to achieve personal happiness. While a noble thought, this is not the case. If you put all of your time, energy, resources, and focus on happiness of others, there will be nothing left for yourself. It is not fair to sacrifice your own wellbeing for everybody else. Additionally, if one did dedicate themselves to the happiness of others, it would be rare for somebody to return the favor, meaning that not only is the individual left feeling emotionally drained, they never end up experiencing the happiness that they worked on hard to give others. Of course, there is no problem with helping others achieve happiness as long as you are focusing on yourself. Picture a happy person as a cup full of water, and an unhappy person as an emtpy cup, it is impossible for an empty cup to fill an empty cup. Thus, one must focus on personal happiness before focusing on the happiness of others.

457,MATERIALISM,"In the society we live in materialism is the norm, but the root cause of materialism goes much deeper than the desire to ""have more stuff"". Our endless drive to acquire goods stems from an inate desire for safety, acceptance, and belonging. We have come a long way as a species. We have developed the capacity to imagine and invent things that make our lives better, but we are still animals when it comes down to it. We still have basic instincts that have never left us. We all feel an urge to belong to a tribe. This is how we survived long ago. We depended on other people accepting us in order to obtain food, protection, and safety. Without those things we didn't stand a chance against predators, the elements, and starvation. 

Buying goods can make us happy for a variety of reasons. We may enjoy the act of using the item or the item may make our lives easier in some way. One of the big reasons that we want to purchase material things is that is signals a certain social standing to the people around us. Teenagers want the latest and most popular sneakers because their peers notice those things and they are more likely to be accepted into the ""tribe"" when they signal that they have the ""cool shoes"". Adults want a Mercedes because it signals wealth and success and people are drawn to those things. It signals the ability to provide the basic necessities that we all need to survive. It is not the good itself that we desire, but the acceptance that comes with it. 

I am not arguing that being materialistic is necessarily a good thing. What does it say about us that we feel the need to impress others with material things in order to be accepted. Shouldn't we base our acceptance of others on more meaningful things such as a person's character, ability to empathize, compassion, honesty? Those things are important, but those are not the things that provide what we are all hard wired to strive for. We are made to want to survive. This is our number one goal. It is a natural instinct that we cannot overcome. We want our species to survive and we want our DNA to be passed down.

The materialism we see all around us is simply a modern day manifestation of something that was always there. We have always been driven to obtain more resources. We have always want to show our worth to those around us in order to be accepted. We have always depended on proving our value to society in one way or another in order to survive. Should we criticize something that is natural and maybe even beyond our control? I say yes and no. When exhorbitant individual materialism starts to harm socierty by making resources scarce then there is a problem. A CEO having billions while people starve is not good for a society and not a sustainable model for its continuation.

Being self-motivated, you may not need the drive that comes from competition to be successful. Being self-motivated may be enough to drive a person even when working cooperatively.

People who are overly competitive tend to focus on winning and this may put them at a disadvantage. For instance, they may be more focused on speed, rather than quality and quantity. They may sacrifice efficiency for speed. Doing something fast does not equal doing something well or efficiently.

People who are competitive are also les likely to seek help from others. Why could they if they are competing against others, meaning that it's them versus the rest? This puts them at a disadvantage because when we depend only on ourselves, we are limited to only what we know and what we can do.

If people make the happiness of others one of their own personal goals for happiness, then, voila, they can kill two birds with one stone. Of course, this would only work if said people actually cared about others' happiness because many may argue that some people only care about their own happiness and don't give two figs about anybody else's.

While I do grant that this is true and that many people are too selfish and self-centered to care about anybody else but themselves, I prefer to believe that the majority of  people do care about others just as much as they care about their own happiness. And let's not get started on those people who are at the other end of the spectrum from selfish people, i.e., people who care more about others than they do themselves. That is not healthy either.

I have had friends and co-workers who think that these two kinds of happiness feed off of one another. I tend to agree. I know from personal experience that when a family member is deeply unhappy, this affects my happiness; but also, when I am sad, this affects my family's happiness. I think that this is the case for  most people who have caring hearts.

Lest you let yourself frequently or for a lengthy time fall into depressive periods, it is vital, I think, to monitor your mental and emotional health and get help when you feel it ebbing. In addition, if you are an extremely caring person, you should guard against the pitfalls of constantly putting others' happiness above your own. Sometimes the people  that we expend such care on do not realize how much of our energy we expend at our own disadvantage. If our loved ones truly care about us, they would not want us to give an unhealthy amount of ourselves,right?

Also, I am sure being legally responsible for the care of others, as is the case for parents, plays a part in what drives one's happiness. Still, I think that most people have as the goal of their own happiness, the happiness of their loved ones, their friends, and their community. And that community can be anywhere from narrow (just family) to wide (global). Let's not forget, too, that people make themselves and others happy in a variety of ways:

And let's not get started on those people who are at the other end of the spectrum from selfish people, i.e., people who care more about others than they do themselves. That is not healthy either.

I have had friends and co-workers who think that these two kinds of happiness feed off of one another. I tend to agree. I know from personal experience that when a family member is deeply unhappy, this affects my happiness; but also, when I am sad, this affects my family's happiness. I think that this is the case for most people who have caring hearts.

Lest you let yourself frequently or for a lengthy time fall into depressive periods, it is vital, I think, to monitor your mental and emotional health and get help when you feel it ebbing. In addition, if you are an extremely caring person, you should guard against the pitfalls of constantly putting others' happiness above your own. Sometimes the people that we expend such care on do not realize how much of our energy we expend at our own disadvantage. If our loved ones truly care about us, they would not want us to give an unhealthy amount of ourselves, right?

Also, I am sure being legally responsible for the care of others, as is the case for parents, plays a part in what drives one's happiness. Still, I think that most people have as the goal of their own happiness, the happiness of their loved ones, their friends, and their community. And that community can be anywhere from narrow (just family) to wide (global). Let's not forget, too, that people make themselves and others happy in a variety of ways: anywhere from giving of themselves, their time, or their money.",4.5,0.956637505

It is a feeling that is elusive and can be difficult to obtain at times. Things that used to make you happy may or may not have the same affect as you grow older.

Growing up I, like many other children, tended to focus on my own goals and happiness. What would make me happy? What is my purpose in life? Where so I belong? All of these things and more seemed easy enough to achieve at the time. Everything is so new when you are young. Discovery is around every corner. Happiness could be achieved with little to no effort in my youth. Whether it was walking down a new trail outside or playing a new video game at my friend's house, happiness was always just a few steps away.

As I grow older, things started to seem more familiar and feelings get more complicated. Some of the  simple things I used to enjoy were now merely a memory. Responsibilities started to stack up and I found myself worrying more and overwhelmed at times. Things started getting so complicated and I would long for the days of carefree summer with friends.

For me these feelings continued as I struggled to find my purpose in life. My path to travel on. I was thinking so narrowly and only looking in the mirror. I grew up and eventually found the love of my life and all of a sudden it hit me. This was no longer just about me, it was about us. My decisions affected her and hers affected me. Of course! This seemed to be my answer for my journey back to happiness.

There was nothing I wouldn't do for my wife but as time passed, I slowly found myself entering back into the chase towards happiness. How could this be?

It was the birth of my first born child. The birth of him felt like the rebirth of me. The secondour eyes met, I broke down into tears. At that moment it was clear to me that I would do anything for my son. I had a family. My love for them was so intense that it hurt sometimes.

My mindset had completely changed to the point where I'm not sure I  could recognize the old me. Every since I became a husband and father things became more difficult. I had less money and so little time to focus on myself, but that didn't matter. Happiness for me more intense than ever and yet so simple. Focusing on my family made me happy. My wants and hust for material items and experiences felt so empty and juveline.

Maybe even something like a game of touch football in your yard with an overly competitive family member? I know I have! Growing up with three older brothers, I constantly found myself in competitive situations. Whether it was a silly game of Monopoly, or competing over who could throw a ball farther, my brothers were always fighting over who was best. It may seem to have driven them to succeed, but all I saw was a temporary high for the winner, and discouragement for the losers. I feel like had they just worked together instead, they would have felt better about themselves, about their relationships with each other, and would have had more of a lasting success with whatever they were trying to accomplish.

Some people may say competition gives people a reason to work at something harder. But this isn't always true. More commonly in my life, I have seen that not everyone is encouraged by comepetition, as some people are just naturally non-confrontational. After years of being exposed to an extreme emount competition, I saw that competition turn into negative feelings and resentment between my brothers. Instead of teaching them how to succeed, it taught them that they always had to be right and better than the other person. I saw my brothers get angry when the lost, or felt like were treated unfairly when they didn't win. I saw them throw things in anger. I saw them not speaking to each other for days over something ridiculous. I honestly stopped wanting to play games because they always ended this way. To me, the competition only brouht out the worst in them and I have even seen it filter over into their adulthood.

While some people need competitive to drive them into doing something, a lot of people are just not emotionally strong enough to handle competition. They don't have the confidence to complete so they automatically get defensive or walk away. These people do not find success in competition, but actually complete failure because they won't even start something knowing they will have to complete with others. Some people feel like it just isn't worth all the arguing and fighting that goes into competition. They would rather sit doen calmly with others to come up with a situation where everyone wins. To me, doesn't everyone winning seen like the ideal situation?


Competition also doesn't support a teamwork mentality in people. It sets people against each other right from the start instead of encouraging people to work together. To me, the more minds working on something, the more diverse the people are, the better and more lasting the results will be. Remembering that everyone is different lives is important. When you complete this is completely taken out of the equation because there is always only a winner and a loser. This doesn't help witha successful outcome regardless of the situation.

When thinking about whether a person experiences happiness from achieving personal goals or when they focus on the happiness of others, one must take into consideration that happiness is fluid and a deeply subjective emotion.
If one must argue the liklihood of one or the other, due to the subjective matter of the topic, it could be useful to use one's own personal experience and reflection  on this topic. Achieving goals that have been pursued for long periods of time and that much effort has been given to, happiness comes from a sense of satisfaction and improves one's esteem. But if others around you are unhappy, then can that joy from personal gains be truly felt? Do we not find it to be ultimately just as satisfying when we have brought happiness and caused joy in another person?  An example from my personal life that I can exemplify this argument with is me finally landing a job in my field after a year of applications, feeling happy at the achievement of my personal gaol, but at the same time feeling sad that I have to move and leave my friends and family behind.

Happiness can be experienced inwardly, in that someone may be happy but not exactly display it to other people, they are content knowing that they can be happy and not have to show it outwardly. People who are reserved and quiet can be just happy as people who are outgoing and socially active.

There are numerous ways that people try to experience happiness. Some derive happiness by participating in physical challenges such as running a marathon or riding a bicycle a long distance. Usually when people take on physically demanding challenges, they are goal oriented. They increase their levels of happiness when they meet or exceed goals that they set for themselves. Others derive happiness by helping less fortunate people by ways of volunteering their time, donating money to charitable causes, or doing errands for others. Then there are those who are only happy when they are able to make other people happy around them.

There are some people who are perfectly happy when they are not doing anything. That is, they can be sitting at home and just daydreaming or contemplating the meaning of life. Deep thinking on subjects such as philosophy, religion, science, art, and other disciplines can bring great joy and happiness to some. While others may find this boring and quite droll.

Happiness can basically be thought of as a state of mind. It can be subjective from person to person. What one finds enjoyable, others may not find it so. For example, as mentioned above, one may experience extreme happiness while being involved with a physically demanding challenge, such as running a marathon. To another person, this would not be considered joyous, uplifting and stimulating. Rather, they would find it as a form of punishment and agony. Thus, they would NOT be happy!

Also, some people have a balanced approach to happiness. That is, they can derive happiness from just about any scenario. They can be just as happy volunteering their time or money to a charity as they could be trying to achieve personal goals. They can be just as happy by being around friends and loved ones as they can be spending time alone in meditation or prayer.

Then there are some who rarely or never experience happiness. There can be several reasons for this. Perhaps being raised in households that are physically and/or mentally abusive or experiencing multiple tragedies such as the death of a loved one, a divorce, being incarcerated for committing a crime, etc.

It is also possible for someone to be too happy. Too much of a good thing, isn't exactly good. It's important for people to experience all emotions, both good and bad, in order to live the fullest life possible. Life isn't always fair, and thus people's emotions can be affected negatively. This builds character and prepares them for future negative events and they are more prepared to deal with them.

To sum up, people from all walks of life experience happiness to a varying degree in various manners. Finding one's own happiness can be a positive experience and in itself can be rewarding. It's better to be happy than sad, pretty obvious! So go find your happiness and enjoy the journey!","    Happiness can vary from person to person, both in how they find happiness, to what degree they experience happiness and how they express happiness to others around them.  Happiness can be experienced inwardly, in that someone may be happy but not exactly display it to other people, they are content knowing that they can be happy and not have to show it outwardly.  People who are reserved and quiet can be just happy as people who are outgoing and socially active.  

There are numerous ways that people try to experience happiness.  Some derive happiness by participating in physical challenges such as running a marathon or riding a bicycle a long distance.  Usually when people take on physically demanding challenges, they are goal oriented.  They increase their levels of happiness when they meet or exceed goals that they set for themselves.  Others derive happiness by helping less fortunate people by ways of volunteering their time, donating money to charitable causes, or doing errands for others.  Then there are those who are only happy when they are able to make other people happy around them.

469,COMPETITION,"Success can be defined in many different ways, especially when recognizing those from an individual. We live in a capitalist country where in many aspects of life, you must outmatch your competition in order to ""survive"". With that being said, cooperation is far more important than competition in our world. Competition leads us to believe that in order to find success, we must put someone else down. This is not the case, and cooperation between groups of people allows us to find success on multipla levels not only for ourselves, but also for what we want to represent.

Cooperation goes beyond just business, team sports, and any working environment. It is crucial part of nearly every aspect of our lives, and most importantly, family. This isn't meant to just point out biological families because sadly, not everyone has a normal family dynamic. But it is also meant to address the close relationships you form throughout your life that allow you to feel a deeper connection with others  that match your interests and morales. This idea goes along with cooperation because in order to be happy and find meaning in our lives, we need people to have our back and who pick us up when we fail. Cooperation goes beyond teamwork, it is instead the idea of humans coming together for the greater good of their desires that they wouldn't be capable of reaching on their own.

Although mu arguement is on the side of cooperation, this doesn't dismiss the relavance of competition in our society. In order to find sucess in a working world, you are more than likely going to deal competition, whether that be competing with fellow job applicants or improving your business to outlast others. Competition is the norm of the business worls and is necessary to survive. With that being said, the achievements that can be accomplished through competition stand nowhere near the success cooperation can provide.

Coming together for a commom goal is one of the greatest things we can accomplish as human beings. The things that we can achieve with the help of others go far beyond anything we can achieve on our own and this is why cooperation is far more important for our world then competition is.","Success can be defined in many different ways, especially when recognizing those from an individual.

470,COMPETITION,"In the 21st century, the most important goals cannot be achieved by a single person. Consider a recent challenge: development of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19. Development of each vaccine required teams of scientists with expertise in viral genomes and the design of vaccine molecules. The scientists' efforts were funded by governments across the globe. Safety and efficacy tests required thousands of healthy individuals to volunteer to participate in the vaccine trials. The data from those trials were analyzed by other researchers skilled in statistical analysis, and then evaluated by government regulators who were financially independent of the vaccine developers.

Those who believe that competition is necessary for innovation might point to the fact that many pharmaceutical companies were spurred into action by COVID-19, and that there was substantial competition between companies to produce an effective vaccine, and to get it into production first. It is absolutely true that competition to dominate the market for this important product may have sped up the development process. However, no company relied on a single individual to solve the multiple challenges of creating a product that could stimulate an immune response, would actually stimulate an immune response before being destroyed by the humany body, compute the number of subjects required for the trials, recruit those volunteers quickly, analyze the trial data, and communicate with government regulators. In other words, each company relied on a large team of indivicuals with different capabilities.

I've selected one recent accomplishment achieved via cooperation, but a similar argument could be made for many other critical advances that have begun to change life in this century, such as development of electrically-powered vehicles and making solar and wind-powered generation of that electrical power feasible.","In the 21st century, the most important goals cannot be achieved by a single person.

471,COMPETITION,"Since the first early humans arrived on the African plains, humankind has used cooperation to build communities, to raise their children, to care for the ill and infirm among them, and economically to share resources to the benefit of the entire community. It is (figuratively) in our DNA and as social animals, we do ourselves a great disservice when we ignore this fundamental component of our humanness. We are pack animals.

In the current year -- and certainly in the United States of America where individualism reigns supreme -- even with the entire world at our fingertips thanks to the internet we are more separated than ever. Loneliness is at an all-time high, thanks in part to the pandemic and the devastating effect lockdowns had on in-person socializing. Go on any social media app and you'll find millions of opinions being flung around like poop in a monkey cage; people don't have conversations anymore, they just yell at each other. We are angry and divided. We have forgotten our roots, back when fur-covered early man worked together to ensure optimal survival in a frightening world full of predators and diseases. Nowadays we aren't getting chased across the plains by blood-thirsty, dinosaur-looking eagles, our biggest threat is ourselves and our inability to relearn how to work together.

This separation is a big reason why we need to embrace cooperation, toward repairing relationships and working together toward a common goal. There's a saying ""the whole is greater than the sum of its parts"" which in the context of this essay can be taken to mean that when people cooperate toward a common goal, the effect they can have is more significant than that which any one individual can make on their own.

Think about the environment for example. Do you dutifully separate your recyclables from your trash? Great! Unfortunately, you and your couple cardboard boxes a week barely make a dent in the problem of modern man overwhelming our home planet with trash. But when we as a society make conscious choices together, we can make a difference. What if everyone who could got rid of their car and rode a bike instead? Or if we stopped ordering plastic junk on Amazon that is shipped halfway across the world in giant, fuel-sucking barges? What if instead we focused on shopping local, and instead of buying out-of-season fruit that has to get shipped in we ate only locally-sourced, in-season fruits and veggies? Perhaps we could make a difference. And that difference could mean a positive impact on the environment, something that benefits all of us.

This author has hope that it's not too late for us. That we can dig down and find that cooperative spirit upon which all of human civilization is founded. By working together and finding common ground, we can have a positive effect on the biggest issues affecting all of us: war, the environment, equality. Life is not a competition, there is plenty to go around for all of us and each of us bring unique strengths to the table; by combining these strengths we become an unstoppable force for good.

A good place to start would be to find common ground with someone very different from you. Have a respectful conversation with someone on the other side of the political spectrum, listen to each other and understand where that person is coming from. You might be surprised to discover similiarities with that person, if not politically then you may bond on a favorite sports team, or perhaps you are both parents and can relate to the sleepless nights of early parenthood. Making this small step to see the world from someone else's eyes might help to reconnect with the spirit of cooperation, of understanding that we are all on this journey together even when we are going our own way. We can then apply this to our own personal struggles and goals, knowing that we have the support of the community and people close to us to support and encourage us all the way.

You are constrained by time, by your own personal failures, and by your small mindset and perspective.

O, happiness comes from being able to step outside of yourself. it comes from being kind to yourself and not focusing on whether or not you fail or succeed. it comes from giving happiness to others and getting it back ten fold. and lastly, it comes from gaining a perspective that makes yoy truly grateful for what you have--so much so, that you feel like happiness isn't even something you have to search for, but something you simply uncover in your own life.


","The steps to achieve true happiness have been heavily debated. Namely, some argue that to be happy, one must focus on themselves, whereas others might claim that happiness comes from focusing on things outside of themselves. I argue that true happiness comes from the latter--from being able to be of service to those around you and to the world.

When you search for happiness through acts of service, you're free from the ups and downs that come with chasing just your personal success. For instance, if the goal is a certain job, title, or status, you won't be happy if you don't have those things or if you fail to accomplish them. Whereas, when you tie happiness to things outside of yourself, the sense of fulfillment is immediate. You don't have to wait days, months, or even years. You're empowered to find happiness all the time and immediately, by just  going out and volunteering, donating, tutoring, helping your community, etc. 

Additionally, searching for happiness in this way has a multiplicative effect. When you go out and are of service to others, you create happiness in those around you that is sure to lift your own mood and level of happiness. In essence, the happiness you experience and receive multiplies in a cycle that can continue to feed itself. This leads to more sustainable happiness in the long run. This same effect is not necessarily guaranteed if you are pursuing independent, personal goals that don't benefit those around you. 

Lastly, when you focus on others in the pursuit of happiness, you might be experienced to situations and stories that give you a whole new perspective and level of gratefulness for your current life. This sense of contentment can cause you to experience more happiness with what you have--without having to make drastic changes in your life. If you tied your happiness to your own personal goals, you might not have this level of exposure or perspective, and might be in a constant state of searching, but not feeling fulfilled.

Now, some may argue that when you focus on your personal goals, you are more likely to be happy, because you are more in control of the situation and are thus better to able to achieve the outcome of a happy life. I argue though, from the examples provided above, that you ultimately have less control when you focus on personal goals.

Overall, happiness comes from being able to step outside of yourself. It comes from being kind to yourself and not focusing on whether or not you fail or succeed. It comes from giving happiness to others and getting it back ten fold.

473,APPEARANCE,"You are on a road trip, and after many hours of driving on the freeway you pass a billboard advertisement for McDonalds. Already salivating, you reminisce on how good those spicy McNuggests looked. So crispy and fresh looking, and they were only $5 for 20 nuggets! How could you pass that up? Immediately, you take the closest exit to find that McDonalds. You get to the drive-thru, order those spicy McNuggets, then pick it up at the end. Then, you pull into a parking spot in the parking lot and open up the McNuggets box. It was warm, but they didn't look anything like they did in the billboard advertisement. They looked uncrispy, stale, old, and dry. If you knew the spicy McNuggets were going to be like this, you never would have ordered them. That billboard advertisement lied to you! You totally thought the item you received would be jult like how it is advertised to be, but it absolutely was not even close. Images and impressions indeed have too much of an effect on people, and this is seen in many other circumstances, not just McDonalds. People are more likely to be enticed by these images and impressions because they are curated to do exactly that.

First, behind every clever advertisement or enticing image is a team of designers that twist the reality of a product or idea in order to make it seem more desirable. These people are skilled in what they do; they know what will draw people's attention, and they make sure that the product is advertised in a way that will achieve that goal. Even though it isn't natural, people will still fall for the false promises of these advertisements because the general population does not know the work that takes place behind the camera in order to produce these attractive images and impressions of products. People think this is how the product really is, so they fall into the trap of supporting or desiring that product solely due to the images and impressions of it.

One may say that people are not actually very affected by images and impressions, but this is not true, especially regarding anti-smoking advertisements. Many brands of cigarettes will have warnings on them that nicotine is a dangerous substance with high potential for abuse, and there are many billboards with images that depict the horrible effect of smoking on the human body, yet none of this prevents the average smoker from quitting, so it can be argued that people are not actually strongly influence by images and impressions. However, to the average non-smoker, these images and impressions are more than enough to deter them from even touching a cigarette. Not everyone is strongly affected by images and impressions for products, but it is accurate to say that the majority of the population is. 

In conclusion, images and impressions have an incredibly strong influence over the general puplation's decisions because the people who curate these images do so for that sole purpose. Today's society is built upon setting good impressions to the point where people believe that those impressions are truly a representation of the item's quality.","You are on a road trip, and after many hours of driving on the freeway you pass a billboard advertisement for McDonalds.

If people were to not fully achieve their goals, this could ultimately lead to unhappiness because they could feel like failures. Also, people could continuously move their goal post, causing them to forever chase something that can never be reached. Others may not have dreams or goals that they know of, and that in itself could lead to unhappiness because people will feel like they have nothing to live for. 

When people focus on the needs and happiness of others, everybody benefits. People are meant to build each other up so that everyone can progress as a society and be happier in general. A goal or dream is both tangible and intangible at the same time because people are always chasing the next big thing. Focusing on others though can give people a real sense of purpose and inadvertently help them become happier along the way. People may not know what would actually make them happy in life, so focusing on others may help them open their minds to something greater than themselves. Life is about learning and growing together, and this will ultimately lead to everyone benefitting from these interpersonal relationships. People need something bigger than themselves to reach real happiness. ",4.5,0.998811881

Happiness is an interesting emotion. Each person obtains and experiences happiness in a different way. What makes one person happy may make another miserable. One specific difference of how people experience happiness is through focusing on one's own goals or focusing more on the happiness of others. I don't believe that there's a right or wrong answer in this situation, but i do believe there's some misunderstanding. Allow me to explain.

It is my personal opinion that people are happiest when focusing on their own goals. I don't think anyone would argue that accomplishing something you put your mind to makes you feel happiness. That accomplishment could be mastering a recipe, getting results at the gym, being promoted at work, or getting good grades in school. Doing these things is usually met with a rush of emotion, joy, and a big smile.

Other people may agrue that focusing on others will give someone the most happiness. I do not disagree that certain people are focused in this way. What I will argue is that you're ignoring the point. In situations like this those people ARE accomplishing their goals. Their goal is to make others happy. It's the same as the gym or recipe example being a person goal. The only difference is that their primary goal is to make others happy/help with the other person's goals. An example of htis would be helping a friend with a big event. In this scenario your primary focus is the goal of someone else (their event), but helping them accomplish this is a personal goal of yourself. It's the same as accomplishing your own goals, you just so happen to be helping others at the same time.

In conclusion happiness is felt and expressed in different ways by different people. Some people feel that happiness is best experienced through focusing on one's personal goals while other argue that it's best experienced through the happiness of others. I believe that focusing on the happiness of others IS A PERSONAL GOAL and that both scenarios are one in the same. If your primary focus is the happiness of others that is a personal goal even if it's not one that's tangible to you.","  Happiness is an interesting emotion.

Nowadays the human race is wasy too infatuated with the idea of how things appear. There is a major problem with beings obssessed with how you hook/how you make an impression. This is because typically a person's character is worth way more than how they look.

As stated previously, typically a person's character is going to be the best judge of them, not how they look. A good example of this when you look at the OJ Simpson case; he was going to be the The Terminator but no one could see him killing anyone due to the fact that he's ""too nice""...but the literally did kill his girlfriend/whomever it was, I don't have much knowledge on the case. Another example would be the Amber Heard/Johnny Depp situation. There's recording of Amber saying something along the lines of ""yeah the world will believe that you, aman, has been harassed"". This is very obviously a major problem in the world today, as the general consensus is that because women look pretty and have boobs, the cannot be mean.

There is a point to be made for the idea that many people do care abot images/impressions, and if that's the case we all should just follow suit. However, this is a terrible idea because following things that look good is exactly why we are in the situation we are in now with basically every country being screwed. As I mentioned, the quality of someone's character is worth so much more than how they look. It is up to the young people of today to raise their children with the idea that you should not compare looks and instead value how good people can be.

To wrap it up, there has always been a problem with people being obssesed with how things look and that has way too big of an impact on everyone. Like stated previously, there are many court cases that kind of show this to the world. Hopefully we as a human race can rid the cancer of comparison from ourselves.

477,COMPETITION,"Rivalry or Teamwork? Which style for motivation and success breeds the best results? Success is subjective, meaning it is may be based on how the individual involved gauges success. So perhaps compeitition and beating others is deemed as success for them? In today's world, indivduals may believe that competition is the best motivator for success as seen with companies such as Coca Cola and Pepsi or even in athletic events. This can be partially due to the fact that one individual reaps the benefits of such success and thus earned it all on their own. However, that is not the case. Competition only goes so far and restricts the ability to grow for companies if they're always comparing to competitors instead of focusing on furher goals. Similar to Batman and the Joker, without Batman the Joker is useless. He loses his competition and thus loses his purpose.

In contrast to competition, cooperation is the best path to take for completing goals as it brings individuals together to work together and bring different innovative ideas to the table as well as a multitude of skills. These ideas and skills combined leads to huge achievements and constant growth for those involved. If an individual only garnered successes by comparing themselves to others, engaging in rivalries and consistently gauging their worth and success by others achievements then they will soon begin spinning their wheels and lose momentum. Couple this with the fact that a competitive environment is more narrow-minded and indivduals sometimes lose sight of the bigger picture due to personal competitive goals, this can actually lead to burn out and breakdown.

This lack of momentum or burn out does not usually drag out in a cooperative environment as the constant new ideas, innovations, thoughts, etc. lead to a constantly changing and improving environment. Even if there is a termporary stall, others can pitch in to assist and push towards victories and progress. If one person could do everything needed to be done for a desired goal then teamwork would not be needed, however it is very rare that a task is a one person job.

Do we buy things because we really want them or because we are just trying to make ourselves feel better with that small rush when purchasing something new? I think this issue has been around for thousands of years but it has changed slightly in our modern society. 

I feel like we as a society deserve criticism for how overly materialistic we have become. Social media has played a part in this problem. We want to be the first person to have something new so we can share it with others and feel like we are part of a certain status group. Ther has also never been a time wher it has been easier to buy whatever we want. Anything you can think of can be delivered to you in 2-3 days, sometimes even the same day.

Using shoppping to fill the void in our lives is very unhealthy and it never works. You need to value yourself more than the things you have.

You could argue this isn't really something that is worthy of criticism though. Being more materialistic than every may just be a sign of how much more successful we are than in previous generations. We have more resources than we need and can purchase what we want. There is no harm in having more possessions than our parents did in fact that's probably what they would want for us. You can be materialistic and value your possessions while still valuing life and experiences as well. If you are purchasing things because you get joy from them I don't see a problem with that.

I believe that there is more happiness to be found from helping others. While there may be truth to gaining happiness from achieving your own goals, you can achieve more happiness from helping others becuase of the total amount of people that gain happiness, the lasting impact of your actions.

To start, by helping others you not only achieve an amount of happiness for yourself but also for ather people If you help one other person, you have now made two people happy instead of one. That is more people happy than if you focused only on yourself. That knowledge can be used to create more value in your actions and (in the end) more happiness for yuourself. Some people may argue that they cannot gain happiness from others if they are selfish and do not care about anyone else's happiness. This can be refuted by simply pointing out that even non-selfish acts of kindness can be twisted in a way to gain happiness only for yourself. There are people that help others imply to gloat that they have helped. It is generally viewed as a positive thing to help others. If others see you in a better light then your value as a person can increase. Is increase in value can be taken to generate more happiness for yourself. This can still be considered selfish since you are only helping others for your own personal gain.

Secondly, I believe that the actions you take to help others can create lasting effects. Creating lasting effects can create long term happiness and can compound with short term happiness. To take this to an extreme, if I save a young perosn's life in some way, then every additional year that person lives can be seen as a positive. I can continue with my life knowing that I changed someone's life for the better. Remembering this throughout life generates happy feelings for myself. Although the positive lasting effects of helping others can be apparent, it is important to remember that there is a ""shelf life"" to any action. You cannot continue to remember one action without it having dimishing returns in happiness. Peoples memory is also unreliable and easily changed. Constantly bringing up an old action can cause the opposite and you may be seen as selfish and out of touch. This can have negative effects on you happiness as those positive actions are tainted with negative emotions.

Overall, I believe that helping others is the best course to being happy. While there are issues with this idea such as selfish people may not be inclined to this thus limiting the amount of people that can be happy by helping people and knowing that helping others can lead to dimishing returns in happiness and eventually may cause the opposite, unhappiness, helping others tends to generate more happy feelings for more people and can have lasting effects.

I believe that a materialistic society disconnects us from our true purpose as human beings and should be criticized for its begative effects on human relationships and our connections to nature.

Modern society is based on convenience. And to have convenience, we need to depend on things, not necessarily people. And that is tge problem with materialism: it disconnects us from relationships and natyure and addicts us to things that can never really replace what all humans need: true connections to others and nature. We can fill our houses with beautiful things, but still be void of love of understanding of what it means to be human, of compassion, of truly knowing what life is about because we are distracted by pretty objects. And so, I believe it is better to rely on people and nature and our own ingenuity and resources than to expect material objects to make us happy.

With less material objects, and the time and money it takes to maintain them, we have time to focus on our relationships, our passions, our connections to the planet we live on, the important things in life instead of concentrating on what we can aquire next. A beautiful sunset cannot be owned, but it is priceless. And in this day and age, can you even imagine how many of them you've missed because you were inside with your things?

Another way that the effect of images and impression is overstated is in the political sphere. This is not a new phenomenon; in the 1960 Presidential debate between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon.

Option B has dull and boring images on the packaging. Which one will capture your attention the most?

A person with a better record, a better ability, or a betterpersonality will always get the promotion,the job they are qualified for, or a number of other things because of apperances.

We are responsible for this though. As a society, we gravitate to beauty and success, even if both are not the reality of the situation, product or person.

People wants things they don't have. Then they go out an buy these items or save to buy them or simply long to have them. All of this drives demand and that drives the economy.

Suppose that people stopped being so materialistic. Suppose people lived with only the bare necessities. What would they do with their money? It's easy to save that people would save this money and live comfortably throughout their lives. But to what end? Would they want to live without the things they like and admire and want? Would we want automobile factories to make basic sedans or station wagons exclusively? Is there something inherently wrong with stainless steel appliances that means we should only have the standard white porcelain models? It's those wants and neds that drive our society and economy.

The acquisition of material goods that people have striv4ed to acquire is a component in achieving happiness and satisfaction. People want what they want.

In time, the government is happy also, because of the taxes collected and rising production numbers.

Feel free to complain about materialism all you want. Feel free to cut back and, by all means, live within your means. But also acept that materialism has its good points, too.

I am convinced that we need to be capable and have a desire to get ahead to live a life that is successful and fulfilling. At the same time, we shouldn't let the desire for more things overtake our life and define who we are.

It is good that we are productive in our lives and that we want to be able to provide for ourselves and our families. Those who are lazy, most often won't get ahead in this life. Those who work hard and put forth ample effort usually are able to provide the things they need and sastify their desire to be useful in their every day lives. We don't have to be overbearing to those around us to be successful in accomplishing what we need to do in this life to be viewed as successful. When we make enough money to provide for our family's needs, then there is no real reason to feel we have to continually get more material things. It is nice to be able to have nice things, but it is only necessary to have enough things to meet our needs.

Of course, there are many people who are on the extreme end of the materialistic scale who feel that they never have enough. They think that the only way they can prove their success it to show that they continuously have the latest and greatest of everything. They buy more and more to prove how successful they are. Some people feel that the only real gage of success is to show your friends and neighbors that you have more than they do. This is often displayed in the arrogance that a person develops over time. Those people have a tendency to look down on others who don't dwell on materialism.

So how do we come to a reasonable compromise on this subject? There may not be one for those who are off the deep end on either side of the spectrum, but hopefully, we can come to some understanding that will be beneficial to all. When we realize that we should not be measured just by the ""things"" we own, but by the ""person we are"", we can begin to set aside some of the material goals and work toward becoming a better person. Feeling good about who we are and how we treat others is so much better than feeling good about the things we own.

487,HAPPINESS,"what is happiness and how does someone find it in their 
life? Happiness is not actually a simple, stand-alone
emotion; it is the result of feeling positive about your life
and your circumstances, enjoying what you do and who
you do it with, the pride of accomplishing a goal, even the 
awe someone feels watching something that amazing
them that they can't understand. Therefore, people can 
find happiness is lots of different places. But I believe that
having personal goals are pursing them is the critical key
to an individual's happiness. Having personal goals 
creates a sense of purpose and meaning. Pursuing and 
reaching those personal goals creates a sense of 
accomplishment, meaning and thus happiness. 

Some people would say that happiness is found in 
focusing on bringing happiness to others, but I would
argue that even that is a personal goal even though it may
not seem like it without thinking it through. Those who do 
for others are doing it because it is important to them and 
increases their own sense of meaning and well being. For
those who do have altruistic goals, the feeling they get
when they help others increases their own happiness even
as they bring happiness to others. Just because it's a 
personal goal doesn't reduce the important or impact of 
the actions people take to help others; the reasons are not 
important, only the results. 

Given this, someone who says they are only happy when
they are helping others may not realize they are still doing
it for their own personal reasons. And that's okay, but it
doesn't change the facts. If it makes someone happier to 
think they have no motive, it really doesn't matter as long
as they feel happy and get satisfaction from it. But I still 
argue that bringing happiness to others is still a personal
goal, thus what makes people happy is achieving the goal 
of bringing happiness to others.

people who are always helping others are less happy because they tend to neglect themselves.

As a result, they never truly get the opportunity or the time to truly pursue their dreams. Even if they do find the time, it is not a full fledged effort, and they often won't be able to do so untill later in their lives resulting in regrets.

Another reason people who focus on themselves are happier is because people who always look to help others are taken advantage of. Others like to ask the latter for favors because they find it very difficult to say ""no"" when someone asks them for help. The big issue with this is that one favor snowballs into many favors and this makes a helper feel like they need to continue saying ""yes"" because they don't want to be viewed as an unkind or selfish person.

If an individual is not happy witj themselves and discouraged if they are not meeting their goals or pursuing their dreams, I think it would be very difficult for that individual to be truly happy for the happiness of others. In fact, to me, it is the complete opposite. If things are going well for me and I'm at peace and content with how my dreams and my goals are progressing, then I can share that,spread that and be happy for others who are fulfilling their dreams.
On the other hand, if life is throwing me a curve ball and I feel like can't a break or achieve what I've set out to achieve, I more than likely would become bitter and jealous of others who are fulfilling their dreams and goals in life. Not saying that I would let that show or let others know that I am jealous but it would be inside of me and more than likely affect me in my approach to persuing my goals and my dreams.
Many people would probaby say that this is salfish and that I should want others to be happy and to reach their goals. Putting oneself  ahead of others should be rewarding and make one feel good about themselves, and while true, if my life is not going as planned, I would have a hard time getting my happiness from those whose lifw is going along as planned.
As a mom, I have always heard a piece of advice from other mothers that you can't take care of your children or parents or friends, if you don't take care of yourself first. If you are unhappy, burnt out, tired, then you don't have much left to give to others. If you are happy, content, reaching your goals, well rested, etc., then it is much easier to help others pursue their goals and to be happy that they are happy.
I do not believe it should be considered selfish for putting yourself first as far as happiness goes.It's more of a need. It helps both physically and mentally. If you can be the best version of yourself, then projecting that onto others just enhances their desire for happiness and for reaching  their own personal goals. It's more of a win-win situation, where more people benefit. Laughter is contagious, so happiness is contagious as well. If  I am succeeding in life, then I want to share that with others so they too can succeed and be happy. Sharing my happiness or my approach in obtaining that happiness and those goals will make me and should make others take careof themselves and their
needs first. This way everyone benefits.
So I believe that true happiness comes from pursuing my dreams and my personal goals and then projecting that success and happiness onto others to hopefully help them reach their goals and dreams and most of all personal happiness.","I believe most people are more likely to be happy if they focus on their own personal goals versus being happy because of the happiness of others.

If you are happy, content, reaching your goals, well rested, etc., then it is much easier to help others pursue their goals and to be happy that they are happy.

I do not believe it should be considered selfish for putting yourself first as far as happiness goes. It's more of a need. It helps both physically and mentally. If you can be the best version of yourself, then projecting that onto others just enhances their desire for happiness and for reaching their own personal goals. It's more of a win-win situation, where more people benefit. Laughter is contagious, so happiness is contagious as well. If I am succeeding in life, then I want to share that with others so they too can succeed and be happy. Sharing my happiness or my approach in obtaining that happiness and those goals will make me and should make others take care of themselves and their needs first. This way everyone benefits.

So I believe that true happiness comes from pursuing my dreams and my personal goals and then projecting that success and happiness onto others to hopefully help them reach their goals and dreams and most of all personal happiness. ",4.5,0.990042674
490,APPEARANCE,"In the world we live in, we are constantly bombarded with advertisements and and things we are encouraged to believe in. There are times when celebrities or politicians try to convey a message that is not necessarily true, or exaggerate the claims they make. It is impossible to avoid this, but does this have too much of an effect on the people and society?

I think that this definitely has too much of an effect on people and society. Since these things are on television, online, and even on billboards in the outside world, it is impossible to ignore. Seeing and hearing these things over and over again, enables the brain to absorb this information, and even if you are not thinking about it, it is subconsiously there to sway you one way or the other. This leads to people believing things, and doing things that they otherwise would not.

For example, if I was thinking of making something to eat, but then see an advertisment for McDonalds, or some similar eatery... I would definitely be inclined to order from one of those establishments. Seeing the food in the commercial looking way better than it actually is, will lead me to wanting it even more, even if I have perfectly good food at home. This happens all the time, and even in cases when you are going to vote. The politican will have a great message shown on television or online, which is exaggerated, and make you want to vote for them. There is also the fact that many things about the politician are left out, which are most likely the negative aspects of the person.

People will say, that these things do not effect them and that we have free will to choose what we want to believe. However, this is not always the case because even without realizing it, our brains are swayed without us even knowing it. Having something put in your head over and over again, will effect you in some way, even if you don't think it is happrning. This is even more true for children and younger adults, becuase they are very impressionable at those ages.

All in all it is quite obvious that advertisments, images, and impressions have an effect on us, or these corporations and/or people would not spend millions and millions of dollars trying to promote their message. Regardless of whether you think these things are right or wrong, they definitely help to sway you in one way or another!","In the world we live in, we are constantly bombarded with advertisements and things we are encouraged to believe in.

Focusing on the happiness of others brings them out of themselves and their daily concerns, and makes them feel a part of something bigger, more universal than individual happiness.

492,COMPETITION,"Do people achieve more success by cooperation or competition? In this article I would like to answer that question.  My personal belief is that people achieve more success hrough competition.  By competing I mean that one or more people are directly trying to achieve the same goal, or are acting as each others protagonists or antagonists in some way.

I think that competition leads to success because the person is stepping outside of his or her comfort zone.  I have read that when you do what is uncomfortable it often times has lasting benefits for the person.  If Oak trees did not have contrary winds as they grew, how would they ever benefit? Also, how can life have a purpose if we never go through any adversity? I know that growing up if I had not had people pushing me to be stronger or smarter, I would have withered into nothing.

Sure, a person could also argue that competition may drive people to avoid failure, or that it will make them have selfesteem issues.  If a person has a kid for example, and they do not place first for a certain sport, they may start to avoid playing the game so that they do not fail.  They also might feel like they aren't as worthy of praise as their more successful peers.  Having more competition between the child's peers may result in their losing desire to play.  If the child's peers cooperate and show him or her that they are a valued member of the team and how to play better, instead of focusing on being better than the child, all the children playing the game may benefit more.

In the end it may be that both competition and cooperation hae their respective places ins ociety.  I think that having everything in moderation is important.  However, competition does indeed help build stronger and smarter people.  It is when competition is taking to an exteme that it becomes unhealthy.

493,HAPPINESS,"Happiness is a state of being that every human seeks. No one wants to be unhappy. People seek happiness in various ways. Some seek happiness through focusing on themselves and their own needs and desires, while seeing the desires and needs of others as something of secondary importance. Others seek happiness through helping others to be happy. The reality is that happiness is largely to be found in helping others.

In my own experience, I've found that if I focus solely on satisfying my own wants and needs, as a natural result, I fail to help others around me as I should. That failure leads me to become isolated from others. They see me as an undesirable person to be around. Then left alone, I feel something is missing inside -- the need for positive social connections. Similarly, when I experience hardships and focus only on them (and thus, myself), they only grow larger in my mind and thus my experience.

On the other hand, when I seek to lift and help others, I feel good as I see them happy, and as a natural result, they are more inclined to be around me and positively interact with me. As I help others, I enjoy the satisfaction of knowing that I have helped them with their needs. I feel that I am a useful and necessary part of the world when I help others to be happy and comfortable. Also, when I experience hardships, as difficult as it may be, if I find ways to help others, my anxiety about my own problems fades, leading me to experience more true happiness myself.

Many argue that it is  important to satisfy one's own needs in order to be happy. Some people say that ""you can't fill another's bucket if yours is empty."" There is some truth to that thinking. It is important to take care of one's self, to a point; but, I am convinced, based on my own experiences, that happiness is more likely to be obtained when most of our focus is on helping others. Often, when people assert that they are engaging in ""self-care"" they may soon find that their happiness is diminished over time. It is easy to become wrapped up in oneself and then lose opportunities to help or otherwise positively interact with those around them. When those opportunities are lost, sadness and other negative emotions naturally follow.

Hence, that largest and truest source of happiness is seeking the happiness of others. My most cherished social connections have come into being and grown from moments when I thought about others before myself. Those satisfying interactions have led me to feel so much more happiness than I could ever find or feel on my own. Lifting the burdens, comforting the sadness, helping heal the hurts of others tends to come back ta a person. Bringing joy, giving encouragement and inspiration to others naturally leads to joy in one's self. Seeking the happiness of others is actually the key to finding happiness for one's self!

497,COMPETITION,"Success is achievable through many different methods however, the most successful two options are cooperation and competition. Cooperation is the best way to achieve success, as it pulls not only from an individual's own experience, but on the group as a whole, pooling together many different sides and experiences. Competition can introduce stressors that can lead to a person's failure in a project. When multiple people cooperate, then those errors will be proofread and evaluated by others all working together for the same goal.

When you have multiple people working together and cooperating, this group of people can achieve much more than a single individual. Teamwork and cooperation go hand in hand. If one individual does not have an answer, then having multiple people cooperating on a project gives you more experiences to draw your answers from. One person may not have a great deal of knowledge on a subject, but could be the expert in preparing and publishing. Another person in the group could be an expert in the matter, but have issues translating to a readable or presentable format. Taking all of the strengths of the group and making up for everyone's weaknesses can elevate everyone's successes. When competition is introduced, then the feeling of needing to hinder others to make your own personal gains enters, and then your success rates will drop.

When competition enters the equation, rushing and constantly comparing your work to others can cause you to make mistakes, or to come to a conclusion you wouldn't have previously. This introduces a new level of error possibility. Competition can motivate, it cannot directly contribute to your own success. This same motivation can come from the cooperation of your group as a whole, and can bring success to everyone involved, instead of to just one person. A group success is much more beneficial to a project than individual successes.

Working alone is limiting, and hinders the amount of information and experience you have available to achieve success. This is why cooperating and working together is the best method of achieving success. For example, you have one person working on a presentation regarding company profits, and you have another group of people cooperating together for the same presentation. The group of people will have more accurate and fulfilling information for their presentation due to the increase in materials needed to come to the correct conclusions. One single person will only have themselves to draw upon, unlike the group.","Success is achievable through many different methods however, the most successful two options are cooperation and competition.

When competition is introduced, then the feeling of needing to hinder others to make your own personal gains enters, and then your success rates will drop. 

When competition enters the equation, rushing and constantly comparing your work to others can cause you to make mistakes, or to come to a conclusion you wouldn't have previously. This introduces a new level of error possibility. Competition can motivate, it cannot directly contribute to your own success. This same motivation can come from the cooperation of your group as a whole, and can bring success to everyone involved, instead of to just one person. A group success is much more beneficial to a project than individual successes. 

Working alone is limiting, and hinders the amount of information and experience you have available to achieve success. This is why cooperating and working together is the best method of achieving success. For example, you have one person working on a presentation regarding company profits, and you have another group of people cooperating together for the same presentation. The group of people will have much more accurate and fufilling information for their presentation due to the increase in materials needed to come to the correct conclusions. One single person will only have themselves to draw upon, unlike the group. ",4.5,0.995286724
498,MATERIALISM,"Everywhere we look, we're met with messages to spend more, buy more, want more. Advertisements are ubiquitous and, increasingly, targeted to us as individuals by algorithms. Through these ads, modern society stimulates desires within us, by telling us that we'll be thinner, richer, or happier if we only have more things. Sometimes, the messages prey on our fears and insecurities: without this product, we'll fall behind our peers, or be seen as ""less than"" by others, in some way deficient. Rather than make us richer, these messages and the accompanying push to grab all that we can, make us poorer. This overarching materialism robs us of appreciating experiences over objects and of being satisfied with what we already have. It puts us in a constant state of stress and worry that whatever we already have, is never enough. It damages our psyhes and our environments.

For example, rather than spend a weekend of free time focusing on experiences that we could enjoy for free, such as playing in a park or reading a book borrowed from a library, we face constant encouragement to shop, to buy the next big thing, to keep up with the neighbors and ""influencers"" on social media. We can become so distracted by these messages and the process of shopping and buying that we forget to enjoy the simple pleasures in our lives such as a leisurely walk and a good homecooked meal shared with friends.

Consider a meal replacement shake that features before and after photos of a person who is unsmiling and appears miserable in the ""before"" photo, but appears delighted in the ""after"" photo. This ad not to subtlely implies that if you resemble the ""before"", then you are a problem that needs to be fixed. It preys on the insecurities of the target audience. It can create worry where before, there was none. There is also no guarantee that the product will give the desired result. As the disclaimer says, ""results not typical."" The person who buys this product is unlikely to be enriched by their purchase.

Our constant parade of unnecessary plastic products that aren't biodegradable and just end up in landfills degrades our environment, and affects the health of our species and other species who inhabit our world.

Now, some will argue that materialism is good. That it's harmless or even fun. That even many seemingly silly or superfluous products add value. That materialism creates jobs and stimulates economic growth.

There may be some truth in these arguements. Some people may enjoy shopping for and buying things that they don't really need, and they may not personally be negatively affected by messages in advertising. But for every person who's not negatively impacted, there's another who is made to feel inferior or ""less than"" if they don't buy, buy, buy.

Silly and superfluous products mass-produced by mega-corporations may seem harmless enough at first glance, or even to add some fleeting value to our lives, but what happens to our environment when they end up in landfills by the billions? The long-term consequences to our plant are real and shouldn't be ignored.

We created our society, and our economy. Therefore, we can change it. We can shape it into something that is more healthful for us, and our environment. It needn't continue to function in the ways that it has in the past, and currently does. We need to consider reshaping our society and economy in a way where it can still function without excess materialism that harms both our health and our environment.","Everywhere we look, we're met with messages to spend more, buy more, want more.

499,COMPETITION,"Do people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition? To answer this question, one must first define success and our measure of success. In this case, we will define ""success"" as the attainment of a shared endevour or goal and our measure will be whether or not it is attained. Competition will be defined as personal success as one individual competes against another. I maintain that cooperation, in this case, will achieve more success than competition.

It would stand to reason that the more people that commit to working toward a goal, the more support one would have for that goal; not only from those who are actively working towards it, but from those who observe the work that those people put into the goal. The more people feel they have support for their work, the more likely they are to put good effort into the goal, and thus reach success.

It is also reasonable to assume that diffferent people have different strengths in different areas. The ability to pool those strengths also increases the chances of success. For example, when writing a successful business proposal both the technical solution and the cost of the solution have similar importance in the evaluation of the response. However, in most cases, the individual(s) whoa re familiar with the technical aspect of the solution are not well- versed in how much it would cose to implement the solution, and that is where the cost calcuation expertise comes in. These individuals both want to win the work, but even if a technical solution is flawless and innovative, the cost to implement the solution may be more than the organization is willing to spend. Therefore, both the technical and the cost teams need to work together to present a solution that is both technically sound and cost- effective. There is no way for their proposal to succeed (win) without both of those considerations, and ergo, without cooperation. 

It could be argued that one may have better success competing with each other. In the above-mentioned case, this would not work at all if the common goal is to win the proposed work. In this case, competition would mean that the technical team would propose the most robust approach possibe, while the costing team would propose the least amount of cost possible, This will result in losing proposal; one with technical merit, but an unrealistic price.

In conclusion, while competition may be helpful when striving for personal or individual goals, is not helpful when trying to reach a common goal. There would be too much time spent on individual success rather than completing common goal. If we cooperate, we all win.","Do people achieve more success by cooperation or by competition?

500,COMPETITION,"One might argue that humans are competitive by nature. We go through life hearing phrases like ""survival of the fittest."" ""the early bird gets the worm,"" and ""close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades."" There is a driving need to be the first, the best, and the one on top. We compete for awards, for bragging rights, etc. Competition does indeed seem to be a natural phenomenon - all living things seem to be in constant competitin for territory, food, mates, everything that is necessary for life to continue. But does that mean competition is a constant necessity? Perhaps there is another way, because there is another phenomenon which exists in nature - cooperation. 

Surely you've also heard phrases like ""safety in numbers,"" ""there is no I in team,"" and ""greater than the sum of our parts."" It's true that exceptional indivduals, winners of competitions, can accomplish great things. An Olymic gold medalist may be the fastest runner or winner, the most graceful diver or figure skater, the most accurate shooter, but all of these things are, when you think about it, relatively small accomplishments, because they're limited by being individual accomplishments. We only realize our true potential when we work together. ""Rome wasn't built in a day,"" and it wasn't built by a single person, either. Some individual accomplishments may stand out when we consider how the world and socieity we live in today was shaped, but our world is the sum of all of these parts. ""We stand on the shoulders of giants."" People and accomplishments are made greater when they can build upon what came before. 

If we truly want to progress, we must continue learning and sharing and communicating.  Competition may result in some gains, for some individuals or groups, but it results in losses for others. The result of competition is a constant struggle. It is difficult to take a step up without a stable platform, or when someone else is trying to pull you down. Cooperation seeks to bring everyone to the same level, to create that stable platform, so that everyone can progress without anyone having to backrack, or being stepped over, or dragged back down. A collective desire for success will achieve far better results than an individual fear of failure. Thus, cooperation, not competition, is the true path to victory.","One might argue that humans are competitive by nature.
